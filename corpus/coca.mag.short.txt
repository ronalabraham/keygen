Al Sobotka, has been driving a Zamboni for the Detroit Res Wings since 1973. // How fast does a Zamboni go? Around 15 mph. Wow You drive that fast? Not too often. The reason is you're trying to do a better job, fill every skate mark. But once in a while you step on it from one end to the other. It makes your hair fly when you hit it, you know? Is there special training required to drive a Zamboni? My training was all done on the job, learning a lot of it by mistakes and from the guys who worked here in the past. I always say I'm still in training. How do you spot rookie drivers? Oh, God, they just look straight ahead They don't observe what's going on around them. I look all the way around the surface to see if I missed a big ice gouge from a skate. Some people go once around the outside and then come up the middle. But I like to go around twice. ice? No, I don't get into that at all. The main concern is the quality of the ice. If it takes an extra minute to do it, that's fine. But if there were a race, I'd win. Does blood clean up pretty easily? Yeah, you got ta dry-shave it first-clean it without water. But if blood gets in the ice grooves, it's hard to get out. Do you ever get asked for your autograph? All the time. Kids, mainly. Mr. Ilitch, our owner, asked me once. In 1995, he had me sign a napkin for him. I was privileged. Be honest: Is the Zamboni a chick magnet? It's a magnet for everybody. Chicks get excited just as much as little kids. Even men get excited by it. Rides are auctioned off for charities and at special events. There have been functions that have gotten $2,000 for a ride. Do the players ever give you props of visiting players say they wish their ice was as good. If you get a compliment like that from Eric Lindros, that's a good one. Guys who skate fast, like Paul Coffey, love our ice. How'd you do in 1999s Zamboni driver of the year competition, in which fans got to vote for their favorite driver? I was runner-up. I got screwed, let's put it that way. But that's not important anymore; it's water down the drain. -Dan Snierson

A RECENT EQUIPMENT REVOLUTION IS BRINGING HIGH-TECH, HIGH-SPEED MANEUVERS TO ICEFISHING // Icefishing has a reputation as a slow-action, slow-to-change sport. And to a certain extent, that reputation is deserved. Dressed in the requisite space-suit garb, icefishermen move more like lunar explorers than Michael Jordan. Then there's the glacial pace of the hand-over-hand retrieve. Even the quarry is gripped by a lethargy that's only intermittently broken by tentative nips at bait-something icefishermen hyperbolically call "strikes." But icefishing's image is undergoing a total overhaul. The last several years have seen a technological surge in every aspect of the sport-from high-speed augers and no-stretch jigging lines, to powerful electronics that put the fish, and your lure, before your eyes. Here's how recent developments have changed the way we fish for winter's predators. NOT LONG AGO, most walleye fishermen were hanging a live minnow from a float, rattle reel or tip-up. But jigging baits have changed all that. Photograph "Are the days of the wooden tip-up numbered? With the technology race in full swing, it live minnow anymore," says Minnesota icefishing guru Dick (the Griz) Grzywinski. "I'll catch a dozen walleyes on a jigging bait for every one I catch on a minnow. Don't use' em-they're not worth the hassle." He's referring, of course, to the timeconsuming chore of manually checking water depth, then positioning bait just above bottom. Which also means that every time you move to a new hole, the depth has to be reset. And because some state laws require anglers to stay within a certain number of feet of their line, that process is a huge drag on mobility. Stick with jigging. Obviously, you'll want to focus your efforts over prime walleye structure, like a sunken island, a distinct point or the inside turn on a breakline. In this capacity, hand-held GPS units are enormous time-savers. Simply punch in your summertime walleye holes, and begin there. You can't just drill one hole and expect to adequately cover the. This presents some obvious logistical-and labor-problems if you use a traditional auger. Which is why super-sharp power augers are becoming so popular. My personal favorite is the Strikemaster Lazer, which is fitted with a unique curved blade that cuts a hole in half the time it takes any other auger I've used. Instead of drilling a hole, checking its depth, then moving on as necessary until you find the desired depth, there are now several hand-held sounders that give depth readings through the ice. The best one I've found is the Polar Vision, which is powerful enough to read through cloudy ice that other units can't penetrate. Or, you might try getting a reading using the transducer of an ordinary depth finder. Just be sure to pour a little water on the ice to provide firm contact with the transducer. If you watch a jigging expert work a piece of walleye structure, you might think he's on a carpet-bombing mission to the bottom." The ice looks like Swiss cheese. But there's a method to his madness. If you're working an 18- to 24-foot break, for example, drill a line of holes along the structure at 18, 20, 22 and 24 feet. This pattern allows you to work your way around the structure at one depth, then jump out to the next series of holes as the fish change their orientation. Walleyes may hold below the deeper holes at midday and then move shallower for the evening bite. This way, your holes are all set to go, and you won't risk spooking the fish off the structure by drilling at sunset. Photograph The quick-strike rig: Stick the leading hook just ahead of the dorsal fin and the trailing hook near the pectoral fin. Photograph Getting used to the circular reading has always been a problem for first-time users of flasher units. Zercom has solved that problem with the introduction of the Vertical Flasher, which, as its name implies, shows action the way it's really happening below you spoons like the Vingla and Swedish Pimple, swimming baits like the Jigging Rapala and vibrating blades like the Cicada and Heddon Sonar. Even plain leadhead jigs tipped with a minnow or minnow head work. My usual choice is a size 3 Swedish Pimple in silver with a green or chartreuse back, tipped with a minnow head (use the entire minnow, and you're liable to get short strikes). The method is straightforward. I use a sensitive 30-inch graphite rod and a small spinning reel spooled with sixpound mono. Simply lower the spoon to the bottom, reel it up 6 to 12 inches and then give it a gentle twitch. Hold the rod tip stationary as the spoon sinks on the twitch-it will flutter out to the side before settling in the original position. Don't jig again until the spoon has completely stopped moving-most strikes come after all movement has ceased. A color flasher like the Vexilar FL-8 helps enormously with jig fishing. A walleye hanging a few feet off to the side of the band or a thin red one. But as the fish moves nearer to the bait, the green band turns red or the width of the red band increases. With a little experience, you'll be able to interpret exactly what's going on beneath youwhether there are any fish, how close they are, which lure actions draw them in and when they're about to strike. Experiment with the force of your twitching and the length of the pauses in between until you find what the walleyes are looking for on a particular day. Twitch anywhere from three to six inches, and wait 10 seconds or so between each bounce. Watch the flasher closely to see how the fish are responding and adjust your action accordingly. Sometimes the best action is no action at all-prop your rod up on a clump of snow and leave it. Just remember that mobility is the name of the game here. If you jig a hole for five minutes and don't see a fish or get a strike, move rather cruise around until they find one hearty meal than chase down a dozen small snacks. Which means that, while you may take an occasional pike by jigging, you're much better off suspending a plump baitfish below a tip-up. The traditional bait is a lively five- to seven-inch sucker, chub or shiner. But pike are often more interested in dead baitfish, particularly oily, smelly ones like smelt or ciscoes. Why the interest in corpses? Not only do pike rely on scent more than any other predator fish when feeding, but it doesn't take a whole lot of energy to catch up to a cadaver. The best way to rig dead bait on a tip-up is on a quick-strike rig using a pair of double or treble hooks. Push one hook into the baitfish near the pectoral fin, the other just in front of the dorsal fin. This arrangement allows you to set the hook much quicker than with a dorsal- or lip-rigged bait. You'll land more fish, and because you, you'll have a better chance of successfully releasing fish you don't want to keep. Use 30-pound-test wire leader and a pair of size 2 to 4 treble hooks if you make your own quick-strike. Of the ready-made tackle, my favorite is the Quickset Rig. The hooks are ultra-sharp and the rear hook slides along the harness to accommodate any size baitfish. Set several baits 6 to 12 inches above the bottom in weedy bays, around the edges of cabbage humps and in shallow backwaters that hold panfish. If you strike out, it doesn't necessarily mean the fish aren't there, it just means they're not at that depth. Pike will sometimes pick up dead bait right off the bottom; at other times, they prefer it hung only a foot under the ice. The only constants are the two characteristics of your bait-stinking and dead. When in Trout WHILE MOST gamefish become sluggish in winter, lake trout get lively under the ice. It's not unusual to get one up powers right back to the bottom. Icefishing for lake trout has become a stick-and-move sport. Time-consuming bait rigs are out, jigging is in. I use a 1/2- to 1-ounce bucktail jig, like the Northland Sting'r Bucktail, in white or chartreuse tipped with a three- to fourinch live shiner, a dead cisco or smelt or a strip of cut bait, such as herring or sucker. If I'm using cut bait or a minnow more than four inches long, I add a stinger hook to account for short strikes. When lakers are suspended off the bottom, a video or liquid-crystal graph is invaluable for keeping track of the fish and your lure. On the whole, looking for lakers is rapidly turning into "virtual fishing." Trout love to chase bait, for example, and you can often tempt a strike by reeling up quickly. On my screen, I've seen the fish follow a bait from the bottom to just a few feet beneath the ice before taking it. Without good was happening. Most flashers don't have the power to reach down the 50 to 200 feet where lakers lurk-a 200 KHZ graph has to have at least 1,000 watts of peak-topeak power. I run a Lowrance LMS 350A graph off a 14-amp motorcycle battery (enough juice to get me through the day). The unit incorporates a GPS, which I use to navigate directly to my fishing spot-usually a structureoriented summertime hotspot. Once there, I switch over to sonar mode. But finding fish doesn't necessarily ensure success. Setting the hook in deep water has always been a problem. If you're fishing in tOO feet of water with mono, for example, you might be contending with almost 20 feet of stretch. The only thing you can do is set the hook and start running away from the hole to get rid of the slack. Or use wire line. But wire fishing is fraught with kinking problems, which sometimes causes unexpected break-offs. The new breed of braided lines, while they have lines, are perfect for deep-water laker fishingthere's no kinking, they're much less visible than wire line and, because they don't stretch, they telegraph bites much better than mono. And when a fish comes calling from 100 feet away, clear reception is the only thing that can ensure a winning connection. // Video enables you to "watch" the action down below.

WHY IS IT THAT A GREAT many boats supposedly built for fishing come from the factory with rod racks that are incredibly deficient? Some are so bad they are more likely to ensure rod damage than promote rod safety. To add insult to injury, very few of these racks hold enough rods to satisfy today's more advanced light-tackle anglers. And considering the rapidly growing popularity of fly fishing in both freshwater and saltwater, the number of rod racks that can not handle anything much over 7 feet in length never ceases to amaze me. The skiff I own today has super rod racks, primarily because over twenty years ago several of us were able to convince the owner of that small boat company that a good horizontal under-the-gunwale rod-holding system had many advantages. I've also helped build up or modify quite a few other boats over the years -- two of them for my own use -- with do-it-yourself rod racks that really worked. Bigger boats can use a combination of storage schemes: horizontally under the gunwales, vertically along the sides of a console, along Some of the really good designs on the market even have horizontal rod storage inside lockers (e.g. the recessed foredeck of an open fishing boat). As far as I'm concerned, angled rodholders in the gunwales are fine for fishing applications such as trolling or live baiting, but poor for long runs at high speeds or trailering on the road. I once had a rod carelessly left in a gunwale angled holder disappear over the side of the boat during a relatively short but fast run in a moderately choppy sea; I never missed the rod until I arrived at my next stop. On several occasions I've seen rods bounce out of identical gunwale holders on trailered boats if the road happened to be a little bumpy. Even if recovered, the rods are usually damaged and the reels don't work very well anymore. Horizontal rod racks are feasible on all but the very smallest of boats. Admittedly, it isn't very practical to stow a 9-foot fly rod horizontally under the gunwale of a 10-foot won't be able to carry six rods per side in a boat that small -- not even ultralight 5-foot spinning rigs. But I can easily get eight casting/fly rods per side in my 16-foot skiff, and even a 14-footer two of us built up almost a decade ago could carry four to six rods per side. Assuming your boat already has sufficient gunwale overhang inside the cockpit to help protect the rods stowed thereunder, adding suitable racks is essentially a matter of installing two vertical supports per side. Extra-long rods like fly rods or casting sticks over 7-1/2 feet, however, will often require some additional support. If you don't have inside gunwale overhang but would like to add that too, there's a relatively easy way to do so. The rod racks can be made of wood, which isn't expensive, and you can easily cut it yourself. Plastic is another option, but this is much more costly, and in most cases you must have someone familiar with the procedures do the cutting I'd suggest it as the most practical choice -- at least for your first effort. The easiest way to get the right fit for under-gunwale rod supports is to first make templates out of cardboard. The supports should be no more than 48 inches apart; otherwise short rods will flex up and down severely when the going gets bumpy. There must also be enough space between the aft support and the transom or any other bulkhead for the rod handles. All rods except fly rods are best supported immediately below the reels. As for the tips, if there is excessive curvature where the longer rods makes contact with the hull, you might want to add the protection of PVC tubing. The heavy walled variety isn't needed, and in fact is more difficult to work with, so use the lightest you can buy. The tubing can be supported in any way that's suitable for your boat, since it won't have to carry any weight. The tubing must be long enough so that the far end, or you're likely to damage some line guides. And, if you wish, you can easily flare the rear end of the PVC by dipping it in boiling water for a minute or so, then expanding it with anything large enough to get the job done -- a soft drink bottle, for instance. Unless there's so much curvature in the hull that the tubing can not be made to conform by hand, you won't have to heat it to bend it. But if you do, the easiest way is to plug one end and fill it full of boiling water. Pour the water out after a minute or so, and then quickly push the tubing against the curvature of the hull so that it fits. Hold the tubing there until it cools sufficiently to retain the desired shape. Obviously, it is prudent to wear thick gloves or use potholders while engaged in this maneuver. The rod supports can be anchored from the top in a variety of ways, and/or. They can also be fiberglassed to the inner hull or inner sides of a fiberglass hull. Top support, along with a flexible adhesive (like 3M 5200) used to anchor the supports to the side of the boat, is the method I've obtained the most satisfactory results with. If you don't want to drill down through the gunwales to attach the supports, you can use sturdy aluminum angle stock to do the same from the underside. Both methods have worked well for me. If you find it desirable to add gunwale overhang inside the boat, you might want to use the rod racks as vertical supports. This usually isn't necessary, however, so whether or not the racks themselves actually touch the cockpit floor isn't important. On some of the smaller round-chine aluminum skiffs I've modified, it wasn't even practical. Adding gunwale overhang isn't difficult, and can be done even with aluminum utility boats that have just a small boxed or circular gunwale, as shown in is a few pieces of clear (knot free) 1x2-inch lumber, and maybe some 3/8-inch to 1/2-inch exterior or marine grade plywood in you want the results even wider. For sections where the hull curvature is too much for the 1x2 to bend without the risk of breaking, make relief cuts 2 inches apart, halfway through the wood. The last time I widened a gunwale this way, it was still as stiff and strong as ever many years later., long after the hull was completely worn out. The wider, stiffer gunwales also considerably reduced the tinny sound of the aluminum hull. To keep the rods in place in the racks, the horizontal U-shaped cuts should be angled downward around 30 degrees. A short piece of elastic shock cord (bungee) for each separate rack will prevent the rods from bouncing out on choppy days. Since the cord will need to be replaced every year or two, I drilled a hole through the top of my rack, then added a small flathead stainless steel a base large enough for the bungee to slip through fits over the screwhead. Just knot one end of the bungee, slip it through the hole in the top of the rack and then through the base of the electrical connector, and tie another overhand on that end. For a worthwhile finishing touch, line the U-shaped cutouts with cork sheeting or thin indoor carpet, which will protect the finish on the rods. Contact cement will keep the lining in place.
They combine most of the virtues of a scope with light weight and small size. Why aren't they more popular? Read on and find out. // IT'S STRANGE BUT IT'S TRUE. America is the world's leader in technology and scientific innovation, but American shooters are as hidebound and stodgy a lot as you'll find. It took decades for the average hunter to discover the advantages of telescopic rifle sights, and now the same slow process is going on with electronic sights. More's the shame, because they can do some things better than any scope or iron sight. The typical electronic sight is less expensive than a telescopic sight of comparable quality. Its small size makes it less cumbersome than a regular scope and that, along with its lighter weight, has less effect on the handling and feel of a firearm. Then there is eye relief: Where the eye relief of all rifle and handgun scopes is quite limited, it is virtually unlimited in the electric sight. You can see the dot and the target whether your you've ever been pounded in the eyebrow by the ocular-lens bell of a scope, this will mean a great deal to you. FASTER THAN FAST Electronic sights are far easier for the beginning shooter to master than scopes or open sights. You simply plaster the big red dot where you want the bullet to go and squeeze the trigger. And finally, far-sighted shooters with eyes that absolutely refuse to focus on the front sight of a firearm will find the electronic sight to be a godsend since it doesn't require the use of corrective-lens eyeglasses. And there's more. The relatively narrow tube of a telescopic sight restricts the shooter's field of view, but an electronic sight, properly used, has an unlimited field. You don't look into it as you do a scope. You simply keep both eyes focused on the target and squeeze the trigger as the red dot settles where the bullet is supposed to go. And since most electronic sights are free of parallax, you'll still hit the of the tube. Photograph For eyes that can no longer focus on the front sight of a handgun, a red-dot is the answer to a prayer, since it puts sight and target in the same optical plane. // All of this makes the electronic sight quicker than quick to use. Out to 25 yards or so, an experienced handgun shooter can centerpunch his target in well under a second, and that includes the time it takes him to react to the buzzer of an electronic timer, raise his gun, aim, and pull the trigger. WHERE THEY SHINE With the exception of Aimpoint's 5000-2X model, electronic sights don't magnify, so they're best for shooting at targets no farther than 100 yards or so. This makes them ideal for close-range plinking, casual target shooting, and small-game hunting with .22 rimfire rifles and handguns. The electronic sight is an excellent choice for use on shortrange woods rifles such as the Winchester 94, Marlin 336, and Ruger 96/44. Same goes for Casull. In states and hunting areas where their use is not prohibited, electronic sights also work great on in-line muzzleloaders. Shotgunners of an experimental nature occasionally give red-dot sights a try at skeet, Sporting Clays, and wingshooting, but they haven't really caught on, and I'll be surprised if they ever do, because they're designed for aiming, not for pointing. However, you who hunt big game with shotguns and slug loads will find the red-dot sight to be just the ticket for bringing home the venison. But it's on a turkey gun that the red-dot sight really shines. Anyone who has patterned a few shotguns knows that it's not uncommon to see a shotgun throw the main part of its charge somewhere other than where you're aiming. But an electric sight enables you to zero your shotgun just as you would a rifle, and once that's done the gun will throw the center off its pattern precisely where the red dot shines. BATTERY ANXIETY I'd guess that they depend on batteries. They visualize themselves aiming at the trophy of a lifetime and, without warning, the red dot suddenly shuts off. Won't happen. For one thing, battery life for most sights is far longer than most hunts, even if the dot is allowed to burn 24 hours per day for the entire hunt. And besides, the dot doesn't suddenly switch off as the battery grows weak. It grows noticeably dimmer, which is your cue to put in a fresh battery, which you had the foresight to keep in your daypack. Most electric sights are rated as water-resistant, with very few rated as waterproof. Even so, I've hunted in Alaska with a water-resistant sight when it rained all the time, and it came through with flying colors. All I did was keep it covered with my raincoat. Mounting an electric sight is no more trouble than mounting a scope. You have to be able to read the directions and use a screwdriver. Bear in mind and bases that will not let the sight slip, and that some rings and bases are stronger than others. I suggest that when you purchase your mounting system, you get it from a dealer who's had experience with serious handguns. To paraphrase the old adver rising slogan, red dots mean sure shots. Give one a try.
. See also cover story of same issue A deer track tells a story. It can begin where a buck crosses a logging road in the Big Maine Woods, or where one rises from his bed in the Rockies -- anywhere Novembers are white, anywhere deer have wild country to roam and hunters have the freedom to follow. It is a tale that unfolds mile after mile, building suspense in a way that few other hunting methods can match, and it doesn't end until you leave the track in defeat or raise your rifle in a moment of glory. For all the opportunities that tracking offers, true aficionados are rare. A core of plaid-jacketed disciples in the northeastern states have drawn attention to the method with pachyderm-size bucks, but most rank and file hunters continue to think of whitetails as being too alert to track close enough for a shot. Consequently, popular hunting tactics are predicated on the notion that it's much wiser to let the deer come to you, rather than the other way around. But if you have the determination to as it takes, then you're already halfway to shooting the animal standing at the end of it. I CHECK THE CONDITIONS Unless you possess a canine nose or a lifetime of experience, you need snow to have a chance at this game. Half a foot of overnight snowfall that stops with the dawn is about perfect, guaranteeing that any tracks you cross will be fresh and the snow underfoot will be silent. Gently falling snow is better yet, because precipitation drives scent to the ground, eliminating one sense from the deer's arsenal of defenses. If conditions are poor, don't become discouraged. A rutting buck will be able to hear you crunching over old snow but may be more concerned with sex than danger. You may get a shot when a deer becomes curious about what is following and investigates. Or you may have your chance when a buck and a doe that are traveling together separate when you disturb them, and the buck swings back to look for her. Maine hunter Dick that walking whitetails generally stop on odd-numbered steps -- three, five, seven, and so on an irregular cadence he tries to duplicate when tracking over crunchy snow, hoping to trick deer into thinking that the intruder has four legs instead of two. II CUT A TRACK Along the northern tiers of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, as well as in parts of the upper Midwest and the foothills of the Rockies where I hunt whitetails, the most efficient way to find fresh tracks is to cruise logging roads. Because relatively few deer inhabit these remote environs (in many places, deer density is four to six animals per square mile) and road assistance is even scarcer, a four-wheel-drive with a good spare and a front-end winch, plus a chain saw for cutting downed trees from your route, can be as crucial to the success of a hunting trip as your rifle. You may easily cover many miles before finding a big track that's fresh enough to follow. Alternatively, you can walk of bucks that are looking for does or on the way from their feeding grounds to bedding areas. III READ THE SIGN Telling the difference between the track of an average buck and a doe can be difficult, but the track of a really big buck -- one that you can stick your fist into -- is about as much like the dainty imprint of a doe as a bobcat's is like one made by a Siamese. Big bucks walk flat-footed and are more likely to show the indentations of their dewclaws. They also give the impression of a widely spaced, staggered stride, with outward pointing toes, whereas does leave a narrow trail of perfect hearts that point to where they're going. Then, too, the farther you follow the hoofprints, the more likely you are to see where a buck's rack has knocked the snow from brush or where he dribbled a little urine as he walked, something that a doe, which squats to pee neatly between her rear hooves, never does. bed that shows dark stains under the body from the buck's tarsal glands. Far more difficult than assigning gender is assessing how long ago the sign was made. There's no substitute for experience; you're going to follow a lot of long-gone bucks before you begin to understand how wind, temperature, and changes in the crystal structure of snow combine to alter a track's appearance over time. Bernier says that the best way to learn is by tracking your dog. Take him out in the snow, then repeat the process at two-hour intervals and note how the appearance, texture, and color of his fresh tracks differ from the older ones. Do this under varying snow conditions throughout the winter. Then, when hunting season rolls around, note how your own tracks change by comparing your boot prints from dawn side by side with your boot prints made at noon or in the evening. IV STAY ON THE TRAIL Okay, you've found the track of a big deer that your homework tells -- check your compass and go. The most common mistake trackers make is following too slowly. During the rut, bucks travel widely in search of does that have come into estrus. If you mosey along, stalking each piece of cover with a step and pause, you're never going to catch up. As a rule of thumb, match your pace to the deer's. A walking deer leaves tracks about 18 inches apart; a trotting buck, 3 to 4 feet. The second error hunters make is tracking with their heads to the ground. You aren't going to see any deer down there. Glance at the tracks briefly, noting their course for 5 or 10 feet (farther in open country), then pick up the slack by walking with your rifle at the ready and your eyes sweeping back and forth. Don't tread directly on the track in case you lose it and need to go back -- and you will lose the track, even in the best snow conditions with a lot of other deer. Other times he may backtrack and then jump off to the side, a defensive maneuver to confuse carnivores that hunt by scent. When you lose a track, make a swing to one side and circle out in front. No luck? Make a bigger swing. Bucks often walk with the wind at their backs. You can try to keep the wind in your favor by leaving the track and circling ahead, but unless the country is relatively open or you know where that buck is likely to bed down, you're just wasting time. Stay on the trail. You'd be surprised at how many big bucks are tracked down and shot with the wind at the hunter's back. Next to aging tracks, the most difficult aspect of this discipline is knowing when the deer is close at hand, dictating that you slow the pace. Often deer will begin to meander and browse a little before bedding down, leaving signs that may not be obvious to the cover, slow down and look hard. Above all, never give up. I once jumped a buck three times in as many hours before finally getting a clear shot. If I'd turned around the first time I made a mistake, I never would have given him the opportunity to make one later. V MAKE THE SHOT -- QUICKLY In deer tracking you don't count antler tines. You don't try to maneuver for a better shot. If you do, you don't shoot the buck. The vast majority of whitetails will be aware of your presence before you are aware of theirs. They may pause for three or four seconds to look at you, or they may be out of the gate and running before you shoulder your rifle. Offhand shots are the rule, and you take follow-up shots as offered. Bernier prefers a pump-action rifle with a peep sight, a combination touted by many trackers as superior for rapid, accurate shooting. A low-power scope is arguably as fast and Whatever gun you carry, practice with it until it becomes an unconscious extension of your arm. Larry Benoit, the famous Vermont deer tracker, has often said, "The hardest part is finding a big buck. The easiest part is getting them out." True enough, but words of encouragement won't help much when you start at one end of a drag rope that's looped around the antlers of a 200-pound-plus animal. Just keep in mind that all the miles you've traveled to get yourself into this predicament were worth it. You've joined the brotherhood of those few who can call themselves deer trackers and acquired a trophy that stands as testament to your woodsmanship, physical endurance, and courage -- the very attributes of the great game animal that lies at your feet. DO YOU KNOW YOUR TRACKS? -- FRESH: Check the edges of a track left in powdery snow with your finger. Fresh tracks give to the touch. Disturbed particles of snow will give a fresh track a feathered the weather has changed. -- 2 HOURS OLD: In powdery snow the edges and midline ridge will set and become firm to the touch within an hour or two. A great way to tell if a print is fresh is to briefly place your bare hand down alongside it and compare the two, because your skin transmits heat to the snow at about the same rate as the deer's hoof. -- TOO OLD: A track not worth following will look distorted and can fill with snow or debris. Under the right snow conditions, an old track can appear fresh in the shade. Check the trail in an open, sunlit spot, where the tracks will show distortion from melting. -- HOW BIG? A fully mature buck (3 1/2 years old or older) will leave a track measuring 5 to 6 inches from toe tip to the back of the dewclaw (hoof length from 3 to 3 1/4 inches). Adult does and immature bucks seldom leave a track more than 4 inches in length can lay a .30/06 cartridge crosswise inside the hoofprint or dewclaw spread, the deer that left it is fit for the wall. -- WHICH DEER? When you pick up the thread of a deer's path where it leaves the confusion of other tracks, you may find that you're following another deer. No two bucks walk exactly the same, and usually one toe will be longer or shaped differently than the other, or a chip in the hoof will make the track distinctive. Learn to recognize the characteristics of the buck you're after so you won't waste time. -- IS HE CLOSE? According to tracking expert Dick Bernier, a reliable indicator that a deer is nearby is a J-hook in the trail. "That means the buck is about to lie down. Generally, I'll drop right to my knees and start looking under tree limbs. If there's any incline, that buck will probably bed on the uphill side. You have to be ready." -- BUCK OR track from a doe track. One clue you can consider is the trail's pattern: The rear hooves of all deer tend to overlap the front hooves. But due to differences in pelvic structure, the rear tracks of a buck often land slightly inside the front hoofprints and sometimes fall a little short of them. A doe places her hind hooves on top of the front track and slightly outside of them. The toes of a heavy buck may splay out a little to each side, giving the impression of a widely spaced, staggered stride, whereas a doe's neat tracks point to where she is heading. A heavy buck is also more likely to leave the impression of his dewclaws. -- OTHER SIGN: Don't confine your observations only to tracks. Cold will quickly freeze lances of urine and pellets. If yellow snow gives to the touch and the pellets are soft with a shiny look, there's a good chance the deer isn't too far down the trail. Bucks leave larger droppings whereas a doe hunches back and urinates in a slight spray pattern straight between her rear hooves.

On the face of it, Lenora B. Fulani, a 42-year-old African American woman who's running for president, should be the progressive woman's dream candidate. Running on a platform that calls for economic democracy, national health care, women's rights, reproductive freedom, and gay rights, she's articulate, telegenic, and media savvy. But for many, the dream turns into a nightmare when they learn she's a candidate and chair of the New Alliance Party (NAP), based in New York City. Cofounded by self-styled psychologist Fred Newman, NAP had ties in the early 1970s to the right-wing fanatic Lyndon LaRouche and a number of other conservative groups. NAP has allegedly broken with LaRouche, but the controversy remains. Is NAP really a progressive group, as it claims? Although NAP describes itself as a "black-led, women-led, multiracial, pro-gay, independent political organization," you'd be hard-pressed to find any progressive organization -- gay, straight, black, white, whatever -- that will align with NAP. Lenora Fulani, working-class family from Chester, Pennsylvania. Fulani was the first member of her family to attend college -- which she likens to "going to Hollywood, it was such a major step" -- and eventually earned her doctorate in psychology from the City University of New York. "There was a lot of devastation, poverty, pain, and craziness in my family," says Fulani. "I was looking for a psychology that had some relevance to the black community and to poor people, and I just hated Freud." In the late 1970s, a colleague at Rockefeller University took her to hear Fred Newman. What she found was Newman's social therapy, which promotes the belief that external social/political conditions are largely responsible for individual psychological problems. These problems are resolved through a combination of "social therapy" and "self-empowering work", sometimes in one of NAP's political organizations. It is this philosophy, linking "therapy" with "politics," that leads critics to call NAP a no exact membership figures, NAP, with chapters in 30 states, claims to be the fourth-largest political party in the U.S., after the Democrats, the Republicans, and the Libertarians. And Fulani has been its main candidate and spokeswoman. Since she joined the New Alliance Party in the early 1980s, Fulani has been running for office. She campaigned first for lieutenant governor of New York state in 1982, then for governor, New York City mayor, and president of the United States in 1988. That year, Fulani became the only female candidate on the ballot in all 50 states, winning over 200,000 votes -- no small feat for a woman running as an Independent. This year, Fulani raised enough funds to qualify for $1,150,000 in federal matching funds. NAP and Fulani say that they raised the money through a network of 200 volunteers (many of them allegedly therapy patients) who collected 40,000 contributions door-to-door, mostly in New York City and California. But NAP, critics say, misrepresents itself and disrupting, and making money off existing organizations. "They talk about democracy, fighting sexism and racism, but their style across the country has been to disrupt community-based groups that are fighting on these issues," says Chip Berlet, an analyst at Political Research Associates in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the author of Clouds Blur the Rainbow, a study of NAP. "They are willing to let the end justify the means. Are they a sinister force of the right or of the government? I don't see that here. This is a group on the left that has gone bad." For instance, Berlet cites the 1984 presidential campaign, when Jesse Jackson, head of the Rainbow Coalition, first ran for president. Simultaneously, NAP formed the Rainbow Lobby, which raised money for international projects. Jackson was forced to publicly disavow any connection with NAP or the lobby. Other groups have their own stories. NAP tried to overrun groups -- such as the New Jewish Agenda, Peace and by staging mass walkouts of their meetings, forming new groups with similar names and acronyms, and scheduling meetings at the same time. NAP also gets low grades from activists in New York City. Although NAP claims to sponsor literacy projects and cultural activities, critics say the party's presence in the city's African American community is nothing more than blue smoke and mirrors. Jitu Weusi, a longtime political activist in Brooklyn and chair of African-Americans United for Political Power, a citywide organization, worked with NAP in the late 1970s and early 1980s, particularly around efforts to remove New York City Mayor Edward Koch from office. But Weusi broke with NAP over what he calls its "chicanery." Weusi says, "NAP tried to co-opt the dump Koch movement. They tried to say they were the crusade. They tried to exclude all of the other groups that were a part of that movement." In this year's presidential election, NAP has made itself felt through guerrilla tactics. Kate McGovern, New Hampshire Citizen Action, had a run-in with Fulani and NAP during the 1992 New Hampshire primary campaign. Fulani disrupted a Democratic presidential candidates forum on health care, cosponsored by McGovern's group. Fulani, sitting in the audience, shouted the candidates down, criticizing the forum as too narrow because only the established candidates were invited to speak. But McGovern disagrees. She says NAP was allowed to attend in limited numbers -- 20 people -- just like any other group. NAP, however, snuck about 50 very vocal members into the meeting, McGovern says. "There is no way that number of supporters would have been admitted to the forum -- had they clearly identified themselves," McGovern says. "I think 'used' and 'duped' characterize my feelings. You want to believe you can trust people who present themselves as progressives, but I find it difficult to believe that Fulani's interested in opposing the right wing in a serious way." Despite such criticism, NAP and Fulani in 1989, U.S. lesbian and gay groups banded together to ask the International Lesbian and Gay Association to reject the New Alliance Party's bid for membership. In a letter, U.S. groups criticized what they called NAP's anti-AIDS policy, its homophobia, and Fulani's takeover of gay rallies in San Francisco and San Diego for campaign speeches. Fulani dismisses such criticism; she sees a sinister alliance between the Democratic party and "Social Democrats who play the role in their community as progressives, but their real role is to make sure that nothing outside the Democratic party develops." I make a distinction between the community and the so-called left forces or the black liberal community, the leadership, because I think it's a very important difference," she responds when asked about the negative reputation NAP has among African American leadership. Fulani insists that "ordinary people, the rank and file", support NAP. "NAP is teaching black people about alternatives to the Democratic party, and the importance of building she says. "I think the black male establishment in this country has been really co-opted. They're covering for their friends in the Democratic party at the expense of black people." But Weusi points out that in New York's 1990 governor's race, of the nine parties that ran candidates, NAP challenged only the two black groups. This time around, Fulani attempted to have Democratic hopeful Paul Tsongas thrown off the presidential ballot in the New York April 7 primary, charging that he lacked the 10,000 signatures required. So is NAP for real? "I don't doubt the sincerity of these people in terms of their dream, but their structure and style is in contradiction to that dream," says critic Berlet. But NAP's success, Berlet says, demonstrates the alienation and ineffectiveness of much of the leftist movement. "Overwhelmingly, the progressive social change movement in this country has abandoned the people NAP seeks to organize. That's a real criticism of the left." Jill.
Janese Swanson and her eightyear-old daughter, Jackie, were watching television during the summer of 1995 when they saw the first ad for a voice-recording toy that they had invented together. They had licensed the product to a toy manufacturer that was now trying to whip up some excitement for the item. On television, a boy held the toy in his hand while a younger girl asked repeatedly for a chance to play with it. He never even looked at her. After 30 seconds, the girl gave up and walked away. Jackie turned to her mother and asked, "Why do they always make the cool toys as if they're for boys?" forgetting, in her distress, that she had helped create the toy. She had certainly thought of it as something for herself as well as for any of the boys she knew. Swanson knew from her own testing of the product that both girls and boys enjoyed playing with it. But she had licensed it to a company that had its own marketing and advertising strategy. Swanson realized that simply change the preconceptions of toy company executives, retailers, or even parents who still believe that microchips are masculine. She would have to create new images of girls enjoying high-tech activities and new toys for them to do it with. Her existing company, Kid One for Fun, Inc., already had an established identity. Rather than yank it in a new direction, she decided to start a new business, and approach potential investors with a plan and mission. The result is Girl Tech. Kid One for Fun still exists on paper. But Girl Tech is where the action is. The new company employs five full-timers who work together closely-brainstorming concepts for girl-friendly high-tech toys-in a small, sunny suite of offices in downtown San Rafael, California. The core creative team, including the designer and writers, is all-female, all in their twenties and thirties. And Swanson's now-nine-yearold daughter still contributes ideas and tests prototypes. The company's goal is to invent technology-based products that are "cool," easy to six and twelve. The easy part has been dreaming up the gadgets. The hard part has been convincing a toy company that girls will buy products that are not pink and fluffy. What do girls want from technological toys? Lots of businessPeople say they would love to know. Only a small number of welldesigned studies have looked into girls' reactions to high-tech toys and games. The Electronic Games for Education in Math and Science (E-GEMS), a research group at the University of British Columbia, has conducted some of the best studies. During the summer of 1993, E-GEMS members timed and interviewed children playing with video and computer games at Science World British Columbia, a Vancouver science center. They concluded that girls enjoyed electronic games, particularly if they could easily get a turn, if other children or adults kept them company while they played, and if the games included strong story lines and welldeveloped characters. Those results were consistent with Swanson's own research on children and high-tech games (she has play preferences and technology). After reviewing all the research in the field, Swanson came to believe that although girls' and boys' tastes are similar, girls are more likely to play cooperatively and to enjoy a game that has few rules and many ways to win. They are also more likely to dislike seeing characters die during the game. At the same time, Swanson knew that some girls found it difficult to join what they perceived to be the macho culture of video games. In her own review of the research, she had seen that children tend to get approval from their peers when they play in ways that are considered "appropriate" for their sex. When they play in what are considered "cross-sexed" activities they are often criticized or left to play alone. Several big companies that have pondered these research results and done their own studies seem to feel that girlfriendly products are a major challenge. For example, beginning in 1993, Sega of America spent more than $200,000 researching possible titles, Sega gave up, at least temporarily, says Roberta Jacobs, a former general manager for Sega of America, now senior vice president at Viacom New Media. Management couldn't see any prospect of a short-term return, says Jacobs. Meanwhile, most of the currently available high-tech games for girls resort to stereotypes. Her Interactive, a division of American Laser Games, released "McKenzie & Co." in 1995, in which girls shop for name-brand clothes in a mall, experiment with makeup, and flirt with boys. Mattel Media's new line of Barbie CDROMs are just as bad: girls print out Barbie stationery or fabric outfits for their own Barbie dolls. At least one other company besides Girl Tech hopes to move beyond those cliches. But Girl Games, Inc., has so far produced only "Let's Talk About ME!" which lets girls learn about health and personality types, make online pen pals, and read their horoscopes. Swanson, 39, has the knowledge and experience she was more technology-minded than girls are "supposed" to be. "I bought appliances for my mom so I could disassemble them," she says. She took apart light switches, the family toaster, blender, and tape recorder so she could figure out what made them work. By the time she entered the workforce years later, it was easy to familiarize herself with computers and their workings. From the very beginning, she developed an impressive record of inventing high-tech fun for all kids. At Broderbund Software, she was product manager for award-winning, highly successful computer games, including "Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?," "Treehouse," and "The Playroom." "Carmen Sandiego," in which children learn geography as they chase a clever thief, not only earned large profits for Broderbund and led to live-action and animated television spin-offs, but was also one of the few early computer games to appeal to both girls and boys. After leaving Broderbund, Swanson founded toys. As at Broderbund, Swanson's aim was to dream up gender-neutral toys. One of them was the Yak Bak, a palm-sized voice recorder that lets kids distort their voices by changing the playback speed. So far, it has generated over $50 million in retail sales for the manufacturer, YES! Entertainment, says Swanson. But even with her own company, Swanson saw again and again that once a manufacturer bought a product, its gender-neutral orientation was dropped in favor of presenting "boy toys." Toy company executives regularly asked her to turn her toys and games into ones that appealed mainly to boys. One voicerecording product that she developed hung like a medallion around a child's neck. In tests, every single girl who tried it wanted one. Most boys liked it, too, but a few said they wouldn't want to wear it. Swanson was pleased by the kids' enthusiasm. The toy company wasn't. Executives insisted that the toy be redesigned so it would shoot in order to send messages. Swanson did what the manufacturer wanted, although wasn't happy that the company thought it was important for the toy to appeal to boys rather than to girls. There have been many other instances in Swanson's career when executives chose to shoot video spots that left girls out or insulted them. According to Swanson, one company created a video to persuade its marketing staff that a walkie-talkie toy could be a hot seller. The video was set in a high school and overwhelmingly showed boys using the product. One of the few girls allowed to speak, at the end, managed to say only that the product was a good way to talk to your boyfriend. Swanson has decided to tackle these anti-girl attitudes head-on with Girl Tech. She says she won't capitulate again to old-tashioned industry attitudes. Instead, she's determined to have a contractual provision in all her licensing arrangements that will give her a greater role in the marketing and advertising of her products. So Hasbro, Inc., has stepped up to the challenge. This fall, Hasbro executives signed a contract with Girl Tech, adding Swanson's line of products to such popular games as Scrabble and Monopoly. Hasbro has agreed to market the products in a way that won't insult girls' intelligence. "We are thrilled," says Linda Halunen, Girl Tech's sales manager. "We're bringing out a line of techie gadgets for girls that are so new and mysterious we can't even talk about it." The line, to be marketed under the Girl Tech brand name, is due out early this year. Until then no one is talking about the toys or the company's marketing strategy for fear that copycat manufacturers will jump in and release "me too" products. What sort of packaging and advertising Hasbro uses to launch the toys is crucial not only for sales, but for Girl Tech's broader mission: to change people's attitudes about technology and girls, and to foster have strengthened her conviction that children's social surroundings shape their ideas about play and themselves. She hopes to use Girl Tech as a force to help change those surroundings. She and her team will develop products in five areas that they say affect children's attitudes and their perception of the world: the business world; the family; schools; broadcast, recorded, and online media; and other children. Girl Tech has also developed a Web site, packed with games, opportunities to send messages to other girls, book reviews, and links to Internet sites reviewed by Girl Tech (see http: //www.girltech.com). In February, around the time when Hasbro is set to launch the Girl Tech line, IDG Books Worldwide, publisher of the "for Dummies" series of computer books, will bring out Tech Girl's Internet Adventures, a guide to more than 200 girl-friendly Internet sites. The book will come with a CD-ROM carrying software that will let girls create their own Web site, which they. In addition, says Swanson, she is talking to a major Internet service about creating a girls' area that would include content and links reviewed by Girl Tech. What about the millions of girls who don't use the Internet? Swanson is developing projects for movie and television production companies. She's planning to create a film or TV series starring the adventurous Tech Girl-whose personality and adventures are still top secret, but who will reflect the themes that permeate all of Girl Tech's work. No matter what the product, or where girls use it, the women at Girl Tech hope that their toys and games will give millions of girls the bone-deep feeling that technology belongs to them. "I'd like to see us standing tall next to Barbie," says Swanson. Rhona Mahony is a visiting scholar at Yale Law School. She is writing a book on women and the computer industry and is the author of "Kidding Ourselves: Breadwinning, Babies, and Bargaining Power" (Basic Books // I look in the mirror &; say good-bye to my face. It's 7:30, the morning of my plastic surgery. I'm due at the does in an hour. When I first go to see him I say, "I like my face, not the effects of gravity." I mean the downward drift of my features that seems to be inscribing the downward drift of my life. The doc's name is Mark A. Erlich. He suggests a face-lift, an eye job, and a chin implant. I decline the implant, imagining infection or slippage. He reaches into the top drawer of his desk and tosses me a small rubber rectangle with a couple of holes punched out. I flex it, liking the feel. I ask about the holes, and he says that's where, in time, tissue anchors the added part. Next, he takes a picture of my left profile. It appears on a computer screen. With an electronic stylus, he erases a fold of skin on my upper eyelid, a extends from nose to chin and gives my mouth a puppet aspect. More erasing, and the loose flesh under my chin disappears, and then the chin itself is extended, becoming aligned with my forehead and nose. I take in the effect, and I'm sold. In minutes, I've shifted from opposing an invasion by a foreign object to accepting the melding of rubber and my flesh. The new position feels like one I've weighed, although I haven't. "How much?" I ask. He says, "Twelve thousand dollars." I have thought I would do this for a long time. I saved for it. My body is home, and surgery is home repair. You need a new roof and weather stripping, no one argues with you. I like looking in the mirror. It doesn't hurt anyone. Vanity (the pleasure we take in our qualities, even our disavowal of vanity) is different from wanting flattery, which to me means isn't, can't be. I like imagining cells engaged in beaverlike activity. I like thinking, period. It's autoerotic, the mind being part of the body and thoughts, therefore, possessing a physical dimension. Thinking, masturbating, looking in the mirror-all encapsulating pleasures, happy narcissism. Let's call this the self-care element. There's something else: my impulse to negotiate life so much through the body. I deal with loss and disappointment by mobilizing the flesh-comforting it, training it-finding a way of reversing the passive position. It's a defense with benign applications. When I look in the mirror and think, "Fine," I can say, "Fuck you" to people who intimidate me. I can do that without the mirror, but the mirror helps if I wind up hurt. There's a third, twisted piece in my head: a carping voice that says, "You need to be fixed." At this point in life, though I still because a I'm my mother's daughter, b I'm female goods in a dick-driven market, and c I'm human), I don't allow it to make my decisions. I say, "Oh, it's you again," and I hunt for the trigger du jour. The truth is, I don't hate my neurotic patterns, don't wish them purged or myself normalized. As with my sexual kinks (pleasures concocted from the raw materials of sorrow and defeat), they remind me what I'm made of, map my trajectories past helplessness. At all times, as I undergo the face-lift, I'm juggling self-care, defense, and carping, trying to keep them straight, though to do so entirely is impossible. I want to be alert, especially, if the voice that picks on me assumes disproportionate weight. Sometimes it does, but I don't forget the other motives, which have more sway these days in controlling the show. Erlich's article on cosmetic surgery, interviewed a slew of doctors, studied their procedures, and watched an operation. She deemed Erlich warm, his fees moderate. I know a woman he's worked on who looks terrific. I meet with her. We're about the same age, with similar slim builds and Mediterranean skin. A year after her surgery, there are no visible scars, and her taut jawline seems an arrow to my future. She says she felt no pain after the operation and healed easily but that, a week or so later, she became depressed. She isn't sure why. I wonder if her fantasies of change exceeded what, in reality, a knife could effect-if that's what depressed her. She reminds me again to hunt for my own devious wishes, lest I be left with them (like egg) on my face. Still, talking to her fortifies my inclination toward Erlich. I think I should research the operation further. After all, it involves blood I'm subjecting my body to incisions and trauma-is what I want to avoid. I don't want facts in my way. I agree to have the lift in two weeks. I'm moving fast. I want to take care of myself, yes, but there's a trigger for the timing, the urgency. His name is Evan. I've just been dumped, and the face-lift is part of a conversation I'm having with him in my head. I've known him a year, been involved half that time. It's been a roller-coaster trip: closeness alternating with withdrawal on his part, a clearing of air leading to more intimacy and, inevitably, punishment for my being "too happy," as he once put it. He didn't want me to expect affection to grow. He chose to end it by starting an affair with someone else. He asked me to stay with him, then changed his mind and wanted out. I wasn't only done to He appreciated my mind maybe more than anyone. But the disappointment was wretched. This happens a week before my fifty-second birthday. The night he confesses his affair, I'm unaware that anything's brewing and dress for the date. The face I see in the mirror must look okay, even pretty, because surgery isn't on my mind. Surgery had flitted in and out of my head while we were together, but his attraction to me drained some of the need. When he pulls out, I feel the rejection as a criticism of my flesh. It's my pattern, although it wasn't his complaint. But for me, the age in my face casts reproach, and my body, too, looks sad, as if the problem has been in me, my body, something that can be mended, though in reality there is nothing I can do. I say to Evan he can't call or see me, wanting to check my fantasies of resuming. The fantasies nature). Evan's body is muscular and beautiful; in my go-into-action mode, the face-lift is a way to level the playing field. I look in the mirror and say, "You're not going to get me," addressing everyone who's ever broken my heart. I would postpone the surgery if I thought losing my boyfriend were its only fuel. It's not, but briefly it gains inordinate weight. I tell everyone I'm planning the lift. To hell with body police, whether zealots who oppose abortion rights or others who judge the desire for beauty to be mere social conformity. To hell with the idea that the changes over which we have no control, like aging, are acceptable, while changes we can influence -- through surgery, bodybuilding, and tattooing-are suspect. My friend John is the most negative, fearing pain and physical risk. He thinks I'll be disappointed when the new face doesn't conjure a new man. I say I'm used to disappointment's reservations go into me or echo some of my own, because the day I pay Erlich, I feel deflated. What if I do die on the table? People will mutter: "Live by the mirror, die by the mirror." Some friends are so enthusiastic, I feel stung. Do I need the work that badly? I imagine my face with years erased, musing on pictures of me when I was younger. At 25, wind whips my hair and I stare at the camera devoid of irony. At 40, my hair is cropped and bushy, and I look hopeful. After the lift, I'm not going to lie about my age, but I like the thought of confounding people-as well as my own assumptions about 50. When I was 14, I'd try to imagine myself in two power-laden years: 1984 and 2000. In' 84, at 37, I'd have duplicated my parents' prickly marriage and predictable, family-centered existence. In the and look gray. As these thoughts would gather, my head would fill with fog and I'd think: "Shoot me now." Today, without children, I feel the body of 14. Perhaps, too, because I'm childless and have no way to project myself physically into the future, nothing drains my desire to prolong youth. I want the face of 25 or of 40-but with the knowledge I've gained since. By the morning of the operation, the aging in my face has assumed grotesque proportions. I am looking at myself as I imagine Evan did at his most unsympathetic-in other words, in my most carping way. On the subway, I reason that the new face will soon look like me, becoming etched, as it must, by my emotions and gestures. At the office, while Erlich marks me with crayons to guide his incisions, I banter jokingly. I've signed forms informing me of a variety of rare but possible results, like asymmetry. "Great, if I don't die under anesthesia." He says he hasn't lost one yet. Photograph Row above: before surgery; row below: ten days after surgery // We enter the operating room, next to his office, as casually as if going for coffee. As the sedative enters my veins, I slip below consciousness. The next thing I know, three hours have passed and Erlich is saying that everything's fine and that I look great. My face is encircled with bandages, from the top of my head to my chin. My friend Esther, who has come to pick me up, is there cheering me, and the scene reminds me in a weird way of the triathlon races at which I'd rooted for Evan. I believed in his body, and I believe in mine, in its ability to obey and contain me. I'm looking forward to recovery as a space to be an animal, take a break from my mind. I'm back I sit on the floor outside his office, awaiting his arrival. He dresses my incisions, removes two drains in the back of my head, and rewraps me. A few days later, with scarf and sunglasses, I ride the subway to his office, eliciting no stares, though, granted, there's a lot of competition for attention down here. At no time during this period am I in pain. I feel discomfort, yes, soreness, tightness. I'm a hardy beast, a fit athlete. I don't smoke, do drugs, or drink much, so throw that in the hopper. But whatever has been said about pain and postsurgical disfigurement, it's not my story. There are incompetent doctors. People die from anesthesia and other risks. It's important to shop for an established surgeon and talk to her/his patients. Warnings serve consumers, but scare stories about cosmetic surgery, which proliferate in the media, are also fingers wagged at people-mainly women, and out to be masochists for (a) conforming to superficial ideals and (b) electing suffering as the price for beauty. No one wants to look good merely because of social pressure. Attractiveness is fun; it feels good. To our guilt -- seeking minds, it's not possible to have fun and feel good without paying a dire price. In reality, it is. I'm told I look pretty, revitalized, and younger than my years, but not necessarily younger than before. One friend thinks I appear more mature, the chin creating classical proportions and changing my previous "childlike look." My friend Sandy-we've gone through our life stages together-says she's not thrilled by the prospect of seeing me look younger, thinking it will intensify her sense of having aged. I realize that, in my excitement, I haven't factored in this reaction from peers. In my desire to look younger, I've forgotten that some people need the space to look the age they are loss and desire is so long-standing and complex. For some, the freedom place is doing nothing. I'm on the phone with another woman when she asks, "Do you want Evan to see you?" The question hits me in the stomach, so I know it's true. Though I don't want the relationship, I'm secretly hoping that fixing my flesh will make him desire me again-so I can be let off the hook of being discarded. A male friend thinks I have erased time and, knowing that the women in Evan's life have generally been in their twenties and early thirties, thinks I intended the lift to "wipe out the young girlfriends." The shoe fits. A month has passed. Friends study my face, getting used to it, and I enjoy the attention. The dramas of getting over Evan and changing my face are done. I've cleared the decks to write fiction and a long essay, and most days sit home feeling insecure about to ride the tension, playing with words and forgetting that what I put out will eventually be seen. Will my face change me, packaging seeping under the skin? I'm satisfied for the moment. My looks are less on my mind than in a fair while, though a weird thing has happened: I forget that this face, like every other, changes each day, depending on sleep and emotions. Evan hasn't seen me. I haven't rekindled his desire, and the whole deal of him has lost air. I do have the face, which in a way he inspired-my parting gift, me. I'm still 52, still L. Stone with scary parts and no mate. I collect more looks from strangers these days: the mutual eye candy that makes theater of ordinary life, the pinball effect where things happen if you're there to bounce against. The confidence is exhilarating. If I live long enough to age so much no surgeon can fix it, then I that's what all life is.

// MS Repair 101 Of the many avenues of MS research, repair of damage to the central nervous system is one of the most exciting. It could mean the restoration of function lost to the disease. In MS, myelin, a fatty protein compound that insulates the nerve fibers in the central nervous system, is damaged by an immune attack. Ultimately, myelin scars over, inhibiting signals making their way along the nerves. Immune attacks also damage oligodendrocytes (the cells that make myelin) and the nerve fibers themselves, once they have been stripped of their protective myelin. It is the subsequent "disconnect" along nerve fibers that creates the myriad MS symptoms-from difficulty seeing to problems with balance and coordination. Repairing myelin, oligodendrocytes, and nerve fibers would probably not be sufficient to reverse MS. There must also be a way to stop the immune system from damaging the tissue in the first place. The combination of restoring function and stopping the damage process would mean the end of MS as we know it. The workshop Last October, 120 researchers of the Central Nervous System in Nice, France. The workshop was organized by the National MS Society and co-sponsored by ARSEP (Association pour la Recherche sur la Sclerose en Plaques, a French organization devoted to MS research). Researchers focused on MS injury and natural repair, what stops natural repair, and ways to stimulate repair. Repair... naturally The body repairs some MS lesions-damaged myelin tissue-naturally. But not all of them are fixed. John W. Prineas, MD, FRCP (University of Sydney, Australia), Massimo Filippi, MD (Scientific Institute and Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy), and others presented evidence of the type of repair and reorganization that helps the brain to overcome injury in MS. In some lesions, the body can repair myelin after injury, either by stimulating neighboring oligodendrocytes or by recruiting young oligodendrocytes from farther away. They move to the lesion, mature, and make new myelin. Some participants noted that this natural repair process may actually be stimulated by the inflammation deciphering the molecular "signals" that are sent out from injured areas to recruit replacement cells in the hope of finding ways to mimic these repair signals. Researchers are also investigating a number of proteins known as "growth factors" for their roles in myelin repair and nerve regrowth. Photograph // What inhibits repair? The human body is incredibly resilient-ask anyone who has ever had a broken leg or had their appendix removed. But in MS, the body's tendency to repair itself gets short-circuited. Marie Filbin, PhD (Hunter College, New York, NY), and Stephen Strittmatter, MD, PhD (Yale University New Haven, CT), discussed three different components of myelin that can actually inhibit nerve fiber regrowth. These components may represent targets for future therapies designed to thwart their influence. Photograph // Catherine Lubetzki, MD, PhD (Hopital de la Salpetriere, Paris, France), who also co-chaired the workshop, discussed crucial interactions that must occur between nerve fibers and oligodendrocytes in order for. These include electrical impulses as well as molecular signals. During the course of MS, nerve fibers stripped of their myelin can become electrically silent, and without an electrical signal, remyelination may be inhibited. Molecular signals may also be lost, compounding the problem. Researchers at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City discussed their studies examining MS lesions that did not show any signs of remyelination (Nature Medicine 2002, 10: 1115-1121). They found high levels of a molecule, named "Jagged 1," that can restrict the maturation of young oligodendrocytes and thus block remyelination. Other approaches to MS repair Moses Rodriguez, MD (Mayo Clinic and Foundation, Rochester, MN), has been purifying and reproducing antibodies (immune proteins that attach to specific molecules) that can stimulate myelin repair in rodents with MS-like myelin damage. Although it is not yet clear how these antibodies act to encourage remyelination, Dr. Rodriguez reported that they are being readied for safety-testing in people with MS. Ian Duncan William Blakemore, MD, PhD (University of Cambridge, United Kingdom), and others discussed their efforts to replace oligodendrocytes and nerve cells surgically. They are using animal models of myelin damage. Potential sources of replacement cells include skin-derived cells, bone marrow and umbilical-cord blood cells, fetal cells, adult brain cells, and myelin-making cells from the peripheral nervous system, called Schwann cells. In a preliminary safety study, Schwann cells taken from a nerve in patients' ankles have been implanted into MS lesions of a few individual volunteers by investigators from Yale University. The results have not been published. Bright horizon Few scientific fields are changing as quickly as the landscape of tissue repair. Scientists uncovered the potential of diverse cells, such as those found in skin and bone marrow, to transform into brain cells only last year. It appears that our bodies contain a virtually limitless source of replacement cells-which may be exploited if the right signals can be found to stimulate their proper transformation and growth into healthy new tissue at the Society and Gary Sullivan is managing editor of this magazine. //
// A good-looking man rolled to the stop sign as I rounded the corner on my scooter. He greeted me; I guess I looked bewildered. "You were my grade school counselor," he said. I was pleased; I wondered which child he had been. I had worked as a counselor at the Mendocino Grammar School in 1995 as an intern. I enjoyed great success with the children and had a good relationship with my peers. There was a job opening for a school psychologist for the following year. I applied; I thought I was a shoo-in. My rsum was impressive and I had been doing the job for a year. I waited eagerly to hear when my interview would be. Three days before school started, I received a call from the principal saying someone else had been hired. I was never even offered an interview. I wanted that job! According to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), all pre-offer inquiries about an individual's diagnosis or possible future disability are prohibited. Interviewers can ask about current readily disclosed; everyone knew I had MS. It was no big deal. Or so I thought. Had I been more savvy, I might have thought I was being discriminated against. Instead, I decided to move on. Does disclosure hurt? Pamela Hirshberg, programs manager at the National MS Society's Southern California Chapter, advises her clients that it might. She strongly urges people to think through how their peers and supervisors might react and to practice what they will ask for with an employment counselor or advisor. "In my employment groups, I tell people not to disclose unless they need a specific accommodation," Hirshberg said. "Even then, they don't need to tell their diagnosis. They need to explain how an accommodation will solve problems caused by a medical condition," she said. Does ADA protect us? According to ADA attorney Charles Goldman, who practices in Washington, D.C., enforcement issues are rarely clear-cut. ADA provisions are a continuing process... open to interpretation non-compliance. But most never go to litigation according to Pamela Hirshberg. "To go to litigation an employer would have to say you were refused a job, or terminated, or not promoted because you have MS. Employers are too smart to do that nowadays," she said. There are many more subtle ways for employers to discriminate. The best, most specialized attorneys may know all the fine points. If you decide to make a formal complaint, it is also very important to have your neurologist on board. You may be called on to provide professional medical opinion about whether you can do a specific job. Clearly fighting employment discrimination in court is difficult, expensive, time-consuming, and emotionally draining. But ADA does offer us some protection because it has helped change public attitudes. Some background I first heard the phrase "reasonable accommodation" years before it became the cornerstone of the ADA. It appeared in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which covered federal employees, and it heralded a change adopted policies of this act long before ADA made them legally obligated to do so. // The ADA was passed by Congress in 1990. It was the first comprehensive legislation passed by any country to prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability. It covers all aspects of the employment relationship, from recruitment to firing, and it goes well beyond those issues to provide protections in public facilities, including transportation, telephones, and more. Historically, ADA is an extension of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, guaranteeing full participation in American society for all people with disabilities, just as the Civil Rights Act guaranteed this for all people regardless of their race, sex, national origin, or religion. The landscape for people with disabilities has changed dramatically in the years since. Before that time it was unusual to see disabled people who were working. Today, attitudinal barriers continue to break down as more people with disabilities become employed. Moreover, employers are aware that there are guidelines as to what constitutes discrimination.. It doesn't apply only to those in wheelchairs. It covers every person with an impairment that "substantially limits one or more major life activities." Invisible symptoms like MS fatigue or bladder dysfunction clearly fit this definition. Initially people thought about ADA making workplaces wheelchair accessible. They weren't thinking about people with MS who might require an adjusted schedule because of issues of stamina. But an adjusted schedule can be a reasonable accommodation based on the "must do" functions of a job. Suppose you are a toll taker on a free-way and MS fatigue leaves you too tired to get to work. You can't expect the highway department to keep you on. (You could ask for a different type of job.) But if you were an accountant for the highway department, you might say, "Let's adjust my schedule." A vacant desk and a vacant tollbooth are two different stories. Adjusting an accountant's schedule could be considered a reasonable accommodation, according to attorney Charles reasonable accommodations keep many people with disabilities employed, and that in turn slowly educates the public about us. The more visible we are, the better. For that reason I roll in the Fourth of July parade in my town every year. When I'm out in public, I'm helping to raise public awareness about people who use wheelchairs. Did ADA work for me? By 1990 my function was noticeably declining. I struggled more and more with fatigue and with pain. I have an MA in Art History and was working as an art critic. I could no longer climb stairs or do the hustling necessary for my job. I agonized about what I should do. With the help of my therapist, I decided to study psychology and become a psychotherapist. A friend told me that California's Department of Rehabilitation (DOR) would help people who needed to make career changes for health reasons, so I contacted them. My DOR counselor was a wonderful man named Stan White. He worked with other excellent counselors. With their help I entered a graduate program and received my MA in Clinical Psychology in 1993. The DOR helped pay my tuition and subsidized books and school supplies. But then my career plans derailed. My marriage ended. I was on my own. And my MS was progressing. I had to move to a rural community, and there I had to develop my own counseling internships. I ended up working with many different populations-from children to alcohol and drug addicts. In all my internships, reasonable accommodations were made for me without questions. I was granted flexible work hours. The DOR purchased an adapted van to carry me and my scooter. Driving instruction was provided. Occupational therapists (OTs) designed plans to minimize my fatigue and maximize my function. It was done with great sensitivity. My life was on a roll. // Then came "The Driving Evaluation." Here I got into some murky territory. The driving test was scheduled over a three-day period. able-bodied person having to climb a wall as part of a driving test. On the final day I was not allowed to drive when my energy was at its peak. The same OT who had taught me to minimize the impact of my fatigue by scheduling tasks for my best times, now insisted that I do several extra transfers, and take the test after I was totally exhausted. I did not pass. I appealed and was granted a new evaluation, but it had to be done in a distant city, where the three-day exam would be compressed into a single day. I tried to argue, but the OT insisted that they needed to see me "at my worst." Ultimately, I was advised to close my file with the DOR. The hand controls would be removed from the van and I would no longer be able to drive. I had no other options, so, reluctantly, I took their advice. I am still processing this loss. Since that time I have works well. There is much work to be done. With my background, I feel well qualified to be part of whatever comes next. Where we all are now Despite ongoing problems, the world is very different from what it was before the ADA. Today individuals with disabilities are far more likely to be contributing their abilities and their intellects to their communities. And the world gets something back. Not to sound like a Pollyanna, but as a therapist, my MS has given me insights into the human spirit I couldn't have imagined before dealing with this disease. Of course, if they found a cure tomorrow, I would take it. After all, I'd still have the insights.

From discoveries about the universe we live in to products created here on earth, we salute 100 of 1994's top science and technology achievements with our seventh annual Best of What's New Awards. This year saw the discovery of one of matter's tiniest building blocks and that of the first planets outside our solar system. Closer to home, $1 prescription eyeglasses were invented as was a test to diagnose heart-attack victims quickly. The products honored this year promise a not-too-distant future of greater ease and enjoyment: Included are a microwave clothes dryer, a car that remembers cabin settings, safer in-line skates, and a computer that's also a cable-ready TV, stereo, speaker phone, and game machine all rolled into one. Continuing a tradition, we have selected a Grand Winner in each of ten categories. The Light Fantastic A conventional flashlight's flaw is obvious: You need a third hand to use it while you're working. So Black &; Decker's SnakeLight loops, twists, and bends to suit any task. You can wrap it over your it to stand on its own. SnakeLight comes in three versions for home, workshop, and automotive uses and costs from $30 to $35. Fossil Mammals See them jump! See them climb! See them hunt! The awesome critters in a spectacular new addition to New York's American Museum of Natural History, from giant elk to a ferocious "bear-dog," are mounted in poses that reflect their lifestyles in past eras. Complemented by interactive computer displays, the uniquely informative exhibits are organized so that the visitor moves through them in a remarkably intuitive and user-friendly way along a major evolutionary tree. The Bug Is Back VW's Concept I is a modern-day revival of the car that once defined the automotive counterculture. Today the styling seems fresh once again. But more important, the car's three different powerplant design options -- including an innovative diesel/electric hybrid -- explore the outer reaches of fuel efficiency and alternative power. The concept may well become a reality, if VW goes ahead with announced plans to produce 1,700-pound eight-legged robot named Dante II wowed scientists with an adventurous trek across the crater of an active volcano. Braving falling boulders and earthquakes, the semiautonomous machine took video images and sampled the gases from vents in the rocky ground. Although Dante II needed help to get out -- it had tipped over and had to be retrieved by helicopter -- it demonstrated that robots can successfully explore distant, dangerous places. Ultimate EOS Canon's top-of-the-line autofocus single-lens-reflex 35mm camera, the EOS-1, has now been topped by the EOS-1N. The new model adds a host of improvements that meets the special needs of professionals and advanced amateurs, including: mirror lock-up to prevent vibration, silent rewind, the ability to focus quickly on any of five different points, and five metering patterns. The camera's list price is approximately $2,400. Synthesizing Virtuosity The best musicians can push a technically well-played tune to artistry by adding personally distinctive sounds, such as the squeaks from over-blowing a horn or breathiness from under-puffing an oboe. But no matter produce such natural sounds-until now. The $4,995 Yamaha VL1 Virtual Acoustic Synthesizer lets keyboardists add emphasis by puffing through its innovative headset. Island of Mystery The $60 Myst is multimedia intrigue at its best, exploiting the CD-ROM format like no other entertainment software. The adventure game transports you to an island world with beautifully drawn 3-D graphics, mystery-shrouded video clips, eerie sound effects, and an original musical score. These elements complement a story line that's intelligent enough to lure adults -- and unpredictable enough to keep them coming back. Model Notebook Toshiba's Portege establishes new standards for small, lightweight notebook computers. It is the first "sub-notebook" to sport a brilliant thin-film-transistor color screen, and the first portable PC of any kind to use the long-lasting lithium-ion battery. The newest model, the Portege T3600CT, beefs up internally with a 50-megahertz 486DX2 chip, a 250-megabyte hard disk, and eight megabytes of memory. Price: $1,299 to $4,799. Grand Award Aviation &; Space Cosmic Catastrophe When the fragments of comet of millions of hydrogen bombs, virtually every major telescope was focused on the event. The spectacle alone was worth it: The largest fragment produced a fireball 50 times brighter to infrared telescopes than the planet itself. Astronomers say that collected data will reveal information about Jupiter's composition and help explain how previous comets may have affected life on Earth. The Clean Diesel Long-haul diesel proponents now have a truly modern choice: Mercedes-Benz engineers have satisfied the clean-air agencies in all 50 states with a six-cylinder engine design that attacks the dual demons of diesel combustion: soot and oxides of nitrogen. Precombustion chambers in the four-valve-per-cylinder head and an oxidation catalyst combine with exhaust-gas recirculation and a variable air-intake system -- both under microchip control -- for cleaner warmup and cruising. E300 diesel sedans start at $40,000. Over-The-Air Cable TV Cost-cutting competition for your cable-TV company typically doesn't exist. Now, wireless technology that costs a fraction of building a ground-based cable system promises to give you more for your cable-TV dollar. CellularVision of New York has. A small transmitter sends the same programming produced by cable-TV companies over the air to receiving antennas that are within a three-mile radius. Light At The End Of The Chunnel After centuries of pondering and puttering, the Channel Tunnel (or "Chunnel") finally opened this May for freight service amidst much fanfare. A grand engineering accomplishment, the 31-mile-long, three-tube system -- the world's longest underwater tunnel -- was bored out of the sticky chalk that lines the bottom of the English Channel. The rail passage between Great Britain and France will enable cars, trucks, and passengers to travel between Folkestone, England, and Calais, France, connecting England with Europe for the first time since the Ice Age. The Never-Set VCR Clock Now you can impress your family, friends, and neighbors with your apparent ability to program your VCR -- if you have Sony's SLV-770HF ($599) or SLV-920HF ($649) models. These VCRs automatically set their own display clocks by using a chip that reads a time TV signal that is reserved for extended data services. Rough Rover Reflecting the heritage and off-road capability that sets Range Rover apart, the Land Rover Discovery is a prestige sport utility at a reasonable, $29,525 base price. Its aluminum body and a long-travel suspension engineered for hard use add up to an unusual capacity for hard going. Comfortable seating, good ergonomics, a big cargo area, and rugged styling lend a luxury-car feel to a vehicle that's equally at home in the wilds. Two Lines From One AT &T; Paradyne's DataPort 2001 modem ($549) is first to let you talk and send data simultaneously over one standard phone line. Assuming the person at the other end has a compatible modem, two people could be looking at the same computer screen, for example, while conversing. This VoiceSpan technology is also expected to show up in some dedicated fax machines, making it possible for two people to talk and fax on one line. Peer Through Walls Zircon's prototype radar locator doesn't row of LEDs. But using ultra-wideband radar technology developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the tool is the first radar that can identify steel, wood, and plastic tubing hidden behind heretofore-impenetrable materials such as concrete, as well as drywall. Future versions of the tool could assist in search-and-rescue operations in collapsed buildings. Batter Up! Step up to the plate and swing away against simulated big-league pitchers with Sports Sciences' Batter Up, a fusion of video game and batting cage. As a ball appears to come toward you, on the monitor, you swing a life-size soft-foam bat with an embedded infrared transmitter that sends a signal when the bat is swung with force. The handle houses all the controls needed for game play. Batter Up works with Nintendo's SNES, Sega Genesis, and Sega CD baseball titles. Price: $129 (cordless) or $69 (corded). Grand Award Recreation Easy Rider Bicycle maker Girvin didn't reinvent the wheels, but it did engineer several other features into the Proflex In addition to having front and rear shock absorbers, the Proflex adds a radical frame design. The compact main triangle allows for a longer rear-suspension unit than other bikes, to soak up big bumps. The frame also enables those under five feet, five inches in height to comfortably traverse the outback with full-sized wheels. Price: about $1,599. Unshackling The Circular Saw DeWalt cuts ahead of other battery-powered tool makers with cordless circular saws that have a blade large enough to saw through a 2x4 on a single swipe. The saws, which are equipped with a 5-3/8-inch thin-kerf carbide blade, are available with either a 12- or 14.4-volt rechargeable battery. The 14.4-volt DW935K model is available for about $230; the 12-volt DW930K, $200. 24-Hour Video-Game Delivery The Sega Channel demonstrates that cable can deliver more than just programs. Households can now receive video games through a channel that is dedicated to data transmission. The data is sent to a memory cartridge that is inserted into the game-cartridge port of any Sega Genesis System. You are offered regularly. Subscribers should pay about $14 a month in addition to their basic cable bill. Powerful Package The PowerPC microprocessor's promise becomes reality in Apple's Power Macintosh series. Propelled by the efficient **32;433;TOOLONG (RISC) chip, Power Macs zip through complex tasks far more quickly than previous Macs -- or most Windows PCs. For scientific, math, and graphics work, Power Macs are the hands-down champions. Add speech recognition and Windows-compatibility options, and you've got the most versatile PCs around. Cost: about $2,000 to $4,500. Running With Fury Reebok's Instapump Fury running shoe has everything you need -- and nothing you don't. The midsole was cut out because runners hit the pavement with the heels and balls of their feet, rather than the middle. Replacing "heavy" leather and laces are light, breathable mesh and air bladders that inflate with an on-board Pump button or a C0 sub 2 cartridge. Each Instapump Fury weighs 8.5 ounces -- 25 percent less than most running shoes By all but proving Fermat's famously intractable Last Theorem, a Princeton University mathematician may have solved a 300-year-old problem. The theorem is simple to state: The equation x sup n + y sup n = z sup n can not be solved when exponent n is greater than 2. But the proof is anything but simple: It took Andrew Wiles more than 200 pages of dense formulas. Understandably, Wiles accidentally left out a step, which he is now working on. In any case, colleagues agree that the breakthrough work will make a lasting contribution to their field. Appointment Watcher From bars of light flashing across a computer screen, the Timex Data Link Watch takes only seconds to load up to 27 entries of weekly appointments, pertinent phone numbers, and anniversary reminders. The watch's light sensor reads the flashing light bars, communicating the information to the watch. The pulses of light equate to the digital ones and zeros that computers use to run programs. The $130 watch comes with the required room's dimensions just got immeasurably easier. The first laser measuring tool, Disto shoots a beam of light to any object from eight inches to approximately 300 feet away, then displays the distance in English or metric units. Unlike ultrasonic devices, the red laser-light dot produced by Disto shows that you've aimed as intended. Accurate to within 1/8 inch, Disto was developed by Leica AG and is also marketed by Sonin. The measuring tool costs about $1,400. Luxury Redefined A sporting sedan that handles a party of four in comfort, the Oldsmobile Aurora represents a new, from-the-ground-up approach to luxury-car design. Starting with a body structure that sets new standards for rigidity, the Aurora adds refined suspension tuning for solid road manners and high performance. With its new aluminum 32-valve V8, the Aurora takes a high-tech route to producing power in a small-displacement engine. Base price: $31,995. Grand Award Audio &; Video Dish It Up Now you don't have to go to the video store or have a cable hookup Satellite System (DSS), you simply press a few keys on your remote control to watch pay-per-view movies beamed from a satellite. DSS also provides access to cable channels and CD-quality music. The system's dish antenna is only 18 inches across, so it is relatively inconspicuous when installed. The basic system costs $699; there are monthly and pay-per-view service charges. Surveying Made Simple Measuring inclines and leveling areas have always been tricky jobs best left for professionals; now Stanley Tools' Compulevel makes them easy. Place the base unit at one end of the work site, then unreel the cord to the other end. Press a button, and the tool displays the elevation change. The technology should find its way to other applications that require measuring differences in height. Available by year's end, Compulevel should cost about $700. The Everything Machine Compaq's Presario 520 CD-TV is an **31;467;TOOLONG multimedia computer in a uniquely elegant package. The Presario includes a computer, 14-inch display, cable-ready TV tuner, answering audio CDs. For rich images and sound, the system supports 256 colors and has a double-speed CD-ROM drive and 16-bit stereo sound card. The TV tuner has jacks for a VCR or video-game system. Price: $1,899. Magic Mirror Display A new technology promises brighter and larger TV pictures than ever before. While normal TVs rely on cathode-ray tubes, Texas Instruments' experimental Digital Micromirror Display creates an image by mechanically moving thousands of tiny mirrors suspended above a silicon chip. Light of any brightness can then be reflected off the mirrors to generate magazine-quality color on screens the size of a living-room wall. Coming Soon To A Runway Near You The next-generation Boeing 777 airliner took flight in June with the most powerful jet engines ever made. With 80,000 pounds of thrust, the giant twin engines make the plane more fuel-efficient than a three- or four-engine aircraft but are as quiet as the smaller engines on a 767. With a wider body than any jetliner except the Boeing 747, the 777 can carry as many as a game show on TV one thing, but actually participating in the show is quite another. With Twisted, a simulated TV game show, you control realistic-looking on-screen contestants: The CD-based game, from Electronic Arts for 3DO machines, lets up to four people play a zany game show complete with video puzzles, sound effects, and trivia. Twisted costs about $60. Versatile Minivan Removing the rear seat from a minivan when you want to carry cargo can be a nuisance. Odyssey, Honda's new Accord-based minivan, offers a superb solution: a rear seat that folds into the floor. Odyssey also looks and handles a lot like a station wagon: It's closer to the ground than other minivans and is equipped with four hinged doors. It shares the Accord's 2.2-liter 16-valve powerplant and should retail for about $23,000. Go-Anywhere Data Merge the simplicity of pagers with the power of computers, and you get the Nationwide Wireless Network, a cord-free data-communications network being constructed by Mtel. Microsoft is lending software. Due to operate in 300 cities next year, the network will deploy an army of receiving stations so the two-way communicators can be small, low-power devices that last a month on batteries and don't need antennas. Smart Walls Developed at the University of Dayton, experimental phase-change wallboard will not just keep the elements out -- it will also help control climate within a house. Tiny beads of paraffin embedded in the wallboard change phases, from liquid to solid, at a specific temperature. So when room air exceeds or drops below that level, the wallboard absorbs or releases heat to keep rooms comfortable. The wallboard could save up to 20 percent of house space-conditioning costs. Grand Award Automotive Technology Aluminum Audi The Audi A8 represents one of the few truly innovative efforts to combine a body structure and manufacturing process that maximize aluminum's benefits. The result is a lightweight, extremely strong luxury car that gains in all areas. The manufacturing plant, developed by Audi and Alcoa Aluminum, also breaks new ground with that makes aluminum practical for extensive use in future cars. The A8 is available in Europe. Silver Shooter The palm-size Pentax UC-1 might qualify as a spy camera -- if not for its flashy silver reflective coating. The camera can focus as close as 12 inches; even at that distance, an auto parallax adjustment system yields a perfect image of the actual picture in the viewfinder -- no more lopped off heads. Other features: a precise 259-step autofocusing system, remote control, and auto flash. Price: $245 list. Six Sides: Better Than Round In the staid realm of washing machines, Staber Industries' System 2000 makes waves by saving water two ways: Its wash basket is flipped on its side, so clothes slosh through a relatively small amount of water. And the wash basket and tub are hexagonal; the flat sides paddle water through the perforations with more force. System 2000 halves the water used by conventional machines and saves detergent too. Cost: $800 to $900. Ocean Explorer Cheaper Odyssey II proved itself in two tests this year: It studied crack formation beneath the Arctic ice off the coast of Alaska in March, and then dove to the site of an underwater eruption off the coast of Washington in August. Odyssey II will help scientists gather oceanographic data, monitor fish stocks, and inspect pipelines. Stylish Minivan By adapting elements of a front-drive passenger car platform to a spacious people-carrier, the Ford Windstar establishes new ride and handling benchmarks for minivans with the traction and space efficiencies of front-wheel drive and fully independent suspension. An innovative feature that enhances seating flexibility is the sliding rear seat, which moves forward to create more cargo room without requiring removal. Price starts at $19,455. Goodbye, Glint Reflections from eyeglasses, binoculars, rifle scopes, and other optical devices can be fatal if they betray a soldier's position. The killFlash shield developed by Tenebraex Corp. could protect soldiers by suppressing glint with a honeycomb grid that fits over lenses. Anti-glint shields could also be used in automobile shields would make them look like part of the car body. Electronic Navigator The Guidestar navigation system developed by Zexel, USA, and refined by Oldsmobile represents a trend likely to be emulated by other car makers. The $2,000 option on the Olds 88 uses a GPS-based guidance system to locate the car, then refers to digitally stored maps to plot a path to your destination. As similar guidance systems catch on, you may never get lost again. NO sub X Stopper More than half of the electricity in the United States is generated with coal. Now, technology from Asea Brown Boveri burns powderized coal more cleanly by as much as a factor of seven. Using carefully controlled amounts of combustion air, the TFS 2000 industrial-furnace design cuts oxides of nitrogen (NO sub x) emissions from a conventional 500 to 1,000 parts per million to 150. Next year, the technology will be used in a 245-megawatt steam generator in Virginia. Eyes-On Camera The ultimate dream machine would obey your thoughts. That remains mere Movieboy E1, which features functions that respond to eye movement. Using technology adapted from Canon's EOS still camera, Movieboy lets you operate, for example, zooming and playback by focusing your eyes on commands or icons. Priced at about $2,000, the camcorder is available now in Japan; U.S. sales are planned for 1995. Grand Award Cars Roomy Compacts Clouds lent their names to Chrysler Corp.'s aggressively sculpted compact sedans, the Dodge Stratus (top) and Chrysler Cirrus. Well-equipped with a standard V6 engine and showing adept road manners, the roomy Cirrus ($17,970 base price) provides a spacious interior bedecked with luxury features. Its Dodge Stratus sister car (available next February) adds two four-cylinder engine choices and a five-speed manual transmission. These fresh Chrysler products are further evidence of new thinking in Michigan. Double-Duty VCR With Go-Video's GV 8050 VCR, copying the videotapes you took with your 8mm or High-B camcorder to the VHS format is as easy as pushing a button. This dual-deck, and assembly editing, where you can put together scenes from as many as eight different sources. Using the $1,099 VCR's external computer port and additional editing software, you can do even more complex editing. Heart Alarms A new blood test developed at Baylor College of Medicine takes the time-consuming uncertainty out of diagnosing possible heart-attack victims. While a standard blood-enzyme test requires 12 to 14 hours, the Baylor test yields a result in two hours or less. Now used at 70 hospitals, the $40 test could save up to $4 billion a year and cut coronary-care-unit admissions by 70 percent. Oh, My Darling Clementine, the first U.S. craft to visit the moon in a quarter-century, is proof that NASA's "smaller, faster, cheaper" mantra is more than just rhetoric. The 500-pound spacecraft was designed and built in only two years, for just $80 million. Jointly developed by NASA and the Pentagon, Clementine could be model for future military-civilian cooperation. Like its namesake, though, Clementine is now to Earth more than one million images of the lunar surface. The Fix Is In Even products like inexpensive hair dryers and electric razors soon could be practical to repair, thanks to new industrial software called Design for Service. The software from Boothroyd Dewhurst uses lists of questions and suggestions (photo) to help industrial designers consider ease of repair when creating new products. Xerox is among the software's purchasers, and Ford plans to use the industrial software to design two 1999-model cars. World Cars Designed without compromise, the Ford Contour (left) and Mercury Mystique stand in the vanguard of automotive engineering. With every important component given a ground-up redesign -- including a new chassis, two engine options, transmission, and even new steering gear -- the cars incorporate innovative basic engineering and sophisticated electronic control systems. The extensive achievement should influence products from Ford and other makers for years to come. Base price: $13,310. Sophisticated Off-Roader Ford's Explorer advances the concept of a rugged, versatile sport utility with a The system is semiautomatic, running in two-wheel drive until tire slip is detected, then transferring power to all four wheels. The 1995 Explorer also incorporates new safety features, including four-wheel disc brakes and dual air bags. Base price should be about $27,000. Tech Toilet The most sophisticated water-stingy commode among today's low-flush models is the Fluidizer from Control Fluidics. The unit combines a pressurized rinse with a blenderlike system that renders all solid material liquid -- so less water is needed to transport the wastes to sewage systems. Indeed, the Fluidizer consumes just 2.3 quarts per flush, while standard low-flush toilets use nearly three times that amount. Walk-Through Windows The GDL Cabrio Balcony Roof Window from Velux is the first to transform from a roof window into a step-out balcony with the flip of a latch. Designed to conform to roof pitches from 35 to 53 degrees, Cabrio can be built into roofs of almost any material. The units measure 100 by 27 inches, and the panes are insulated with energy-efficient argon glass fill Technology Solar-Powered Resort It doesn't look like much, but that's the idea. The world's first solar-powered luxury resort, Harmony was intended to blend into its pristine surroundings inside the U.S. Virgin Islands National Park on St. John. Harmony's eight cottages -- there'll be 32 eventually -- were designed to fit among existing trees. Each cottage is constructed almost entirely from recycled materials, and there are interactive computer programs to teach visitors about Harmony's various environmental and alternative-energy features. Genuine Jaguar The 1995 XJR sedan reprises the graceful lines of classic Jaguars, updated with state-of-the-art underpinnings. The supercharged four-liter in-line six features a unique air-coolant-air intercooler and develops 322 hp at 5,000 rpm and 378 foot-pounds of torque at 3,050 rpm. All-speed traction control, antilock brakes, dual air bags, and improved ergonomics inside add up to the most civilized cat ever. A wood-rimmed steering wheel adds a retro touch. Base price: $65,000. Cheap Heat To boost building-heating efficiency, the elegantly simple perforated aluminum panel called Solarwall pre-warms absorbs as much as 80 percent of the available solar energy -- a record for solar air collectors. Developed by researchers at Conserval and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the panel sells for $10 per foot and could pay for itself in energy savings in as little as three years. Smaller Is Better Anyone who has wielded a poorly balanced hand tool knows that bigger is not necessarily better. About 15 percent smaller than its competitors, Panasonic's Predator line of cordless drills/drivers sets impressive standards for utility and function. Top-of-the-line models sport a 12-volt battery that recharges in 15 minutes (photo). The motor is variable-speed, reversible, and has 21 torque settings for driving screws. Price range: $199 to $229. Bookshelf Video-CD System The first video CD mini component system, model SC-VC1O from Panasonic plays up to 74 minutes of full-motion videos from five-inch discs using the MPEG-1 digital video-decompression standard with the addition of a TV set. The unit also plays audio CDs and CD + Graphics (karaoke) titles. Sold be available in the United States this fall under the Technics label. T-Bone Protection A regular air bag does little good if your car gets T-boned from the side. First to bring a side-impact bag to market, Swedish designers cleverly located the device in the side of the 1995 Volvo 850's seat side holster -- rather than on a door panel. That means the air bag is always correctly positioned to protect the driver and front-seat passenger, regardless of seat adjustment. A $500 option on 1995 Volvo 850 models, the air bag is standard on 850 Turbo models. Bravo For Brakes Too timid to try in-line skating? Never fear: Automatic Braking Technology (ABT) from Rollerblade now enables anyone to stop with ease and confidence. When you put one foot in front of the other to stop, an arm pushes the brake downward against the ground. Because the wheels don't have to leave the ground while braking, you maintain balance. ABT is available on the new Bravoblade series and on two older Detector After long delays, the first national radar network designed to detect severe thunderstorms and tornadoes is now mostly in place -- and it's exceeding expectations. Nexrad, as the Next Generation Weather Radar is called, relies on high-resolution Doppler radar and modern computer graphics to spot and report the swirling winds indicative of violent storms. Nexrad has doubled average warning times for tornadoes and flash floods and halved the false-alarm rate for all storms. It's A Gas Homeowners who live in areas where electricity prices are high have a new heating-and-cooling alternative: York International's Triathalon, the first residential-size gas-engine-driven heat pump sold in this country. Heat pumps are devices that provide heating and cooling in one unit. Because Triathalon reuses warmth produced by the motor, it heats 40 percent more efficiently than the top-performing furnace; it also cools as efficiently as a dedicated electric air conditioner. Grand Award Home Technology Microwaves: From Popcorn to Pants Its microwave-oven-style door is the tipoff: This is no ordinary clothes dryer. It uses microwaves to. And because microwaves heat the water rather than warm the air (thus "baking" the clothes), the dryer is gentler on fabrics and can even handle silk and wool. Developed by the Electric Power Research Institute with AsTEX/Gerling Laboratories and Thermo Energy Corp., prototype microwave dryers are now being tested. Magic Pair Sony's Magic Link and Motorola's Envoy (shown) are the latest in handheld communicators. (Photo omitted) Each employs General Magic's whimsical Magic Cap interface and "intelligent" Telescript communications system. Magic Link and Envoy both have a standard (corded) fax and data modem inside, and Envoy also includes a wireless radio-frequency modem for greater portability. Magic Link costs about $1,000. Envoy is expected to be available by year's end for about $1,500. Matsushita (Panasonic) and Philips are also working on devices using General Magic software. Speedy Data Traveling Software's SpeedSync blows through network-cable and phone-wire bottlenecks, dramatically increasing the speed of computer file transfers. By recognizing what changes changes rather than the whole file -- boosting speeds by up to 800 percent, and saving time and long-distance charges. SpeedSync appears first in LapLink for Windows. Grip And Go Energy efficiency or high performance? It's been a tradeoff for tire designers -- until now. Michelin's XSE technology reduces rolling resistance by 35 percent and improves traction in wet conditions without skimping on other performance characteristics. A form of silica replaces the conventional carbon black as a strengthening rubber additive. The technology is implemented in five models including the MXV4 (shown). (Photo omitted) Refined Ute With the GMC Jimmy and Chevrolet Blazer, General Motors elevates the design that started the compact-sport-utility craze to a new plateau. The Jimmy/Blazer ($22,438 base) handily executes the difficult hat trick for a sport utility: It blends a smooth ride and reasonable handling with substantial off-road capability. The key was in combining a serious reengineering of the Blazer's suspension with careful tuning of tires and shock-absorber combinations. Space-Radar Lab Using powerful synthetic-aperture-radar imaging stream beds beneath the Sahara Desert's dunes and mapped the 5,000-year-old city of Ubar in Oman. (Sand dunes are at the bottom of the image at right, though the ancient city itself is not visible.) (Photo omitted) The first shuttle mission was conducted in April, and the second blasted off in September. Part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth, the Space Radar Laboratory has made measurements of snow packs, geologic features, and ocean wave heights at 19 ecologically sensitive sites, gathering detailed information on natural and human-caused changes. Computer, Take A Memo The first dictation product for Windows PCs, Voice for Windows brings Kurzweil's accurate, large-vocabulary, speaker-independent voice-recognition system to today's most popular software. The speaker-independence eliminates tedious voice "training"; you can begin talking to your PC immediately. The system lets you do spot training as needed to improve accuracy. Voice for Windows includes a sound board and microphone and lists for $995. Minimalism, Italian-Style The Ducati 916 brings the road. Narrow and agile, the 438-pound sport bike has a compact fuel-injected twin-V engine that uses the Italian maker's signature desmodromic valve-actuation system to produce 104 hp. The slightest inputs at the controls elicit a balance of acceleration, braking, and rock-steady cornering most cyclists only experience in daydreams. Price: $14,500. Green Light Because it consumes a scant 0.03 watts, you can praise Limelite for its energy efficiency. Or you can cheer that the night light has no bulb to shatter, or that the slim little light doesn't generate enough heat to cause burns. Limelite uses a durable electroluminescent material to cast that soft, green glow. Developed by Austin Innovations, the device costs about $8. Grand Award Photography Flexible Compact The remarkable Contax G1 35mm camera has reengineered the staid interchangable-lens rangefinder category. The camera's unique design incorporates an autofocus system to complement manual focusing, and a 1/2,000-second top-speed focal-plane shutter. The resulting titanium-clad electronically controlled camera combines the flexibility of a single-lens-reflex with the size and handiness of available. Price of the G1 body: $1,790. Watts New Talk about impressive numbers: The $350 Lightning Charger produces 900 watts of 115-volt DC current, 55 amps for charging, and 80 amps of starting power. But it weighs just 16 pounds and measures less than one cubic foot. The secret: The generator's neodymium iron boron magnets are ten times more powerful than ordinary ones. Now sold with a two-stroke powerplant, Lightning Charger is also available in a $450 version that generates 800 watts, or about eight amps of AC power. Master Mechanics Well-rehearsed teams of space-walking astronauts performed brilliantly for 11 days to correct the optics and replace flawed components of the Hubble Space Telescope. In a $630 million mission, the space shuttle Endeavour crew restored the $1.6 billion orbiting astronomy lab's performance to within shooting distance of its original design. This year, breathtakingly sharpened images of distant galaxies and confirmation of a black hole's existence are early fruits of the masterful rescue mission. High-Tech Racer The Patriot, Chrysler into a high-performance race car, demonstrates a new approach to advanced research. The car is powered by innovative technology, including a liquefied-natural-gas turbine, flywheel energy storage, and high-amperage electric drive. Building a car for international racing at LeMans imposes deadlines on getting the Patriot running and provides a venue that tests the vehicle in the crucible of competition. Top Quark Now there are six -- six quarks, that is. The top quark, avidly sought since 1977, has almost certainly been found in the energy fire storm at a Fermilab accelerator. Quarks are fundamental particles that comprise nuclear matter: protons and neutrons. The master concept by which physicists picture nature, called the Standard Model, demands that six kinds of quarks exist. Without the top, this view of the universe would crumble. Better Battery AER Energy's Power 220 rechargeable battery pack is the first to use zinc-air technology, which offers roughly three times more energy per ounce than nickel-based cells -- and about one-and-a-half times more than the latest lithium-ion batteries PCs for 15 to 24 hours and also simultaneously power most handheld cellular phones. The battery pack weighs about six pounds; AER is working on smaller versions to fit inside laptop PCs. Long-Play Recorder Norris Communications' palm-size Flashback digital recorder weighs just three ounces -- but its Intel memory cartridges hold an impressive 30 or 60 minutes of high-quality recordings. Flashback has just two buttons: one records, and the other controls the fast and slow forward, stop, and play functions. A planned optional adapter and software will let Flashback's PCMCIA-compatible interface download recordings to a PC. List price for Flashback, which comes with one 30-minute cartridge: $250. Have It Your Way Many luxury cars have memory settings for seat and mirror positions, but the new Lincoln Continental takes that convenience to the next level: Touch a button, and the car automatically adjusts a dozen different settings to your personal preferences. For example, you can program for a low, normal, or high steering effort. The car remembers the set. Dream Laser An affordable laser printer that produces brilliant color pictures to complement its ability to print razor-sharp text has long been a fantasy for millions of PC users. Now, Hewlett-Packard makes that dream a reality with the Color LaserJet, at a list price of $7,295. The breakthrough one-pass, direct-to-drum imaging process renders true-color output at reasonable speeds and affordable prices -- typically six to 30 cents per page. Grand Award Science &; Technology Other Worlds For the first time, a planetary system has been found orbiting a star other than the sun. Alexander Wolszczan, a Pennsylvania State University astronomer, used the giant radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, to observe puzzling variations in the radio waves emitted by a spinning pulsar, a star 1,500 light-years away. His conclusion, now widely accepted, is that "irrefutable evidence" proves the existence of at least three planets around the star. Super Fast, Super Slick Breaking the mold, the Nikon 35Ti's unique camera-top readout has analog display dials and pointers exposure compensation, frame count, time exposure, and self-timer use. (Shutter speed appears in a digital viewfinder display.) The super-fast lens is a Nikkor wide-angle 35mm f/2.8, and the viewfinder's aspheric lens provides maximum brightness and color balance. Price for 35mm not yet set; a 28mm Ti is also available. Special Spectacles Morr-Sight's patented prescription eyeglasses could be produced for as little as $1 a pair, making better vision more affordable for the poor. The company's system includes a mobile eye-care van that dispenses computer-assisted eye exams and standard lenses and frames (photo) that can be assembled for a custom fit on site in minutes. (Photo omitted) With a grant from Hershey, Morr-Sight has brought eye care to more than 4,000 people in Pennsylvania. Air-Quality Control Once limited to European luxury cars, the electrostatically charged air purifier is filtering down to more mainstream vehicles. Freudenburg Nonwoven's units draw cabin air deep inside the filter to prevent clogging of the outer surface area. In the trapped. Now available on the Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique, such filters will likely become commonplace. Meet You At The Computer So far, yet so near. That's the feeling you get with Intel's ProShare Personal Conferencing Video System 200, a desktop videoconferencing package for PCs. While you see the faces of the people you call on your computer screen, you can simultaneously share information and software. The most complete and affordable product of its kind, ProShare includes all needed hardware and software. Cost: $995 to $1,995, depending on phone-company discounts. More, More -- And Less The car that set new standards for luxury sedans five years ago has raised the stakes. The 1995 Lexus LS 400 ($51,200 base) has more power, more head and leg room, and less weight than the model it replaces. Add to that stately new body lines and a zero-to-60 time of less than seven seconds, and you have a vehicle that will no doubt frighten European luxury-car makers -- again. light, researchers at Lockheed Missiles &; Space Co. have discovered a way to reduce the cost of camera, microscope, and telescope lenses dramatically. The first product incorporating the technology is a liquid-lens assembly for a 5.5-inch f/10 refractor telescope. Made by Epoch Instruments, the $2,500 lens assembly is comparable with $4,000 assemblies made from solid materials. Gas Ranges Clean Up Though favored by chefs, gas ranges have had drawbacks: They release combustion by-products (including carbon monoxide), as well as natural gas when a low flame or pilot light blows out. Now the Canadian Gas Research Institute has developed the first gas range with a ceramic cooktop and sealed combustion chamber. A fan draws fresh air from outside into the chamber, then expels combustion by-products. The Institute is working with manufacturers to market the range. Digital Soldier The first digital uniform promises the 21st-century soldier an array of unprecedented capabilities: With a GPS receiver, he'll be able to pinpoint his exact location at all times. With wireless digital communications, with infrared sensors displaying information directly in his eyepiece, he'll spot the enemy before the enemy sees him. The Army plans to produce 4,800 of the Digitized Soldier high-tech uniforms by early next decade. Grand Award Computers &; Electronics Simon Says: Do Everything A hand-held computer inside a cellular phone's body, Simon is a "personal communicator" in the fullest sense of the term It can send and receive voice calls, electronic mail, faxes, and pager messages -- all without wires. Developed primarily by IBM for BellSouth Cellular, Simon sports a bright LCD screen and a card slot for adding new functions. A host of organizing features includes an appointment calendar and address book. List price: $899. Robo-Mower No, that's not a mutant grass-chomping turtle. It's the Weed Eater Robotic Solar Mower. Running on 34 solar cells, the 12.5-pound device snips grass while the sun shines. It operates within the boundaries marked by a thin buried wire; when the mower senses an obstacle, it kind sold in the United States, the Weed Eater mower costs $2,000. A Classic Overachiever The rear-engine air-cooled Porsche 911 is a classic design that nearly defies improvement -- but the 1994 911 nevertheless reaches new heights. A new rear suspension is both compliant and predictable -- a high achievement for any rear-engine car -- while the body is smoothed and modernized. An aggressive, flat-out sports car, Porsche has survived the passage of time to become even better. Base price: $59,995. Bona Fide Black Hole Black holes have been part of space lore for decades. But their existence was unproven until this year, when a research team used images from the improved Hubble Space Telescope to spot a black hole in the Virgo constellation. The scientists measured the speed of a gas disk (right) rotating around an unseen object, and determined that only a black hole could have sufficient mass to keep the gases spinning at such a high rate. Flight Without Fuel Pathfinder, an unpiloted all-wing prototype aircraft 100 feet in span flying solely on electricity from its photo-voltaic cells. Developed by Paul MacCready's AeroVironment **28;500;TOOLONG company, the solar drone will find uses in aerial surveillance, environmental monitoring, and as a communications relay. Adding a fuel-cell energy-storage system should permit Pathfinder's 200-foot successor to fly for months at a time in the rare air that exists above 60,000 feet. 3-D CD CD-ROMs usually store data as a layer of tiny bumps and grooves burned onto a carbon disc. But why be limited to making use of only two dimensions? IBM researchers increase data capacity by a factor of ten with an experimental "multilayer CD" consisting of stacked translucent discs. To read the CD, a laser with a movable lens simply focuses on the appropriate layer. This technology could soon store entire feature-length movies on one CD. Porta-Fax The pop-up acoustic coupler an Smith Corona's Handifax 1000 enables you to send faxes through a handset -- even via your cellular phone. The 13-ounce unit, which can transmit to any standard fax machine, includes features, including a phone book, an automatic phone dialer, an appointment scheduler with calendar, a calculator, and a clock. List price: about $600. No-Fret' Net First there was NCSA Mosaic, shareware (free software) that vastly simplified access to the mammoth Internet with on-screen menus controlled by a mouse. Now the Mosaic XS goes that one better: It can run over the 14.4-kbps bandwidth and higher, making it up to ten times faster than the shareware version. Mosaic XS also lets you work with documents as they're being transferred to your computer and retrieve information from multiple areas on the Internet simultaneously. Mosaic XS should cost around $150. Bright Light, New Laser Until now, you could only get one wavelength of energy for any given combination of semiconductor materials in a laser. But in the experimental quantum-cascade laser developed at AT &T; Bell Labs, the same layered semiconductors can be made to produce a variety of wavelengths simply by varying the thicknesses of the conducting materials. This by conventional ones; the laser could someday become an important tool for monitoring air pollutants. Affordable Luxury At a base price of $25,995 the Mazda Millenia combines luxury and sporting cues in a harmonious, precision package that won't plunder your pocketbook. Artfully designed inside and out, the Millenia is enhanced by good handling and a superior ride. Millenia is also the first passenger car to offer an optional Miller-cycle engine, a supercharged yet nearly inaudible powerplant that improves mileage. Ultimate Cordless Phone? By today's standards, it is. The Extend-a-Phone 9200 cordless from Uniden combines the extra-long range of a 900-megahertz phone with the added security of spread spectrum, a technology that scrambles your call and hops among channels. The $590 unit also includes handy home-office features such as three-way conference calling, two-way intercom, and two separate phone lines. Best of what's new The Year's 100 Greatest Achievements in Science &; Technology (omitted)
In addition to sleeker lines, Chevrolet's redesigned Venture now has a shorter, lower nose that greatly improves the view of the road ahead. // JUDGED SOLELY on image, the minivan comes up short against the upstart, more rugged sport-utility vehicle. But for the road trip, a softball game, the carpool, or any of a long list of domestic chores, minivans remain the ultimate people move and cargo carrier. And tgere's nothing ho-hum about the soccetr mom's best friend, either. Performing a multitude of tasks - and carrying out each at least reasonably well - is nothing to scoff at. Accomplishing these feats of versatility has been a continuing challenge for manufactures, which are faced with designing supensions stiff enough to handle widely varing loads without sacrificing ride comfort, building in enough structure to withstand a crash without stealing precious interior space, and juggling the need for acceleration and fuel economy. For buyers, flexibility and ease of use reign supreme. Comfortable seats with multiple configurations, easy entry and exit, spacious cargo compartments and passenger room measured. Chysler set the standard in 1983 with its steel-bodied, shortnosed front-wheel-drive Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager, and this platform still dominates the market. Variations come and go. Until this year, for example, Ford split its efforts among the reardrive Aerostar and two front-wheeldrive minivans-the short-wheelbase Mercury Villager and the larger Ford Windstar. The demise of the Aerostar at the end of the' 97 model year leaves Ford with the two front-drivers. GM is the most recent domestic manufacturer to emulate Chrysler, shifting from the composite-bodied, front-drive series that it sold through its Olds, Pontiac, and Chevrolet divisions from 1990 to 1996. After carefully studying the competition, the automaker's engineers have outfitted the Chevrolet Venture, Pontiac Trans Sport, and Oldsmobile Silhouette vans with an all-new steel body. GM now offers its new vans in two wheelbase sizes: 112- and 120-inch. For our comparison test, we selected the short-wheelbase Venture and long-wheelbase Trans Sport (with the sporty Montana package) to sample the difference. To spice (introduced last spring), which features a new, wider driver's-side door. Chrysler was represented by its most efficient package: the short-wheelbase Voyager with an upgraded 150-horsepower four-cylinder engine. (The latter is obviously at a power disadvantage in comparison with the V6 engines in the GM and Ford minivans, but other powerplants are available.) Rebuilt from the ground up, the new GM minivans have taken a cue from their counterparts at Ford and Chrysler in abandoning what was GM's most distinctive feature-the steel space frame and all-composite body. The combination had a lackluster stiffness-to-weight ratio; the allsteel structure is quieter and stiffer, vastly improving ride and handling. GM engineers next addressed the biggest single flaw in earlier GM minivans: poor forward visibility. The long hoodlines on previous models earned them the uncomplimentary nickname "dustbusters." The longish fronts also made parallel parking a bit dicey. Later versions boasted a shorter nose, but sensing the van's front edges while parking was still tricky. This latest package is a the windshield wipers are hidden from view. Retained is the most ingenious feature: lightweight, individually removable rear seats. A new optional driver's-side sliding door follows up on Chrysler's successful introduction of this feature; GM has a distinctive, electrically operated passenger's-side slider as well. Photograph The interior of the Plymouth Voyager favors legroom over cargo space in this shortwheelbase version. The longer-wheelbase model has more luggage capacity. Rollers on the seats (below right) make it simple to remove either the rear or middle seats for more cargo room, as well as to push the seats after they are outside the vehicle. Photograph In GM's new minivans, lightweight modular seating folds into several combinations, with the seatbacks doubling as small tables or folding down for a flat, shelf-like storage area, creating the most flexible interior arrangement (above left) in the test group. As shown here in the Chevrolet Venture, cargo netting and bins abound for storing odds and ends. // The Venture has the shortest wheelbase in the length, however, is the 72-inch width. That cuts significantly into cargo and passenger space, especially shoulder room. Even the longwheelbase version of the Venture, the Trans Sport, has less passenger room than the short-wheelbase Voyager. The extra space created by the rectangular upper body of the Venture and Trans Sport compensates somewhat. The modular seats are easy to add or remove. They can be configured into five seating groups, including an eight-passenger setup (on the Trans Sport), and the seatbacks fold into a table-like affair. Though comfortable, the seats-particularly in the rear-offer less lower back support than do Ford's and Chrysler's. And although GM advertises its theater seating, the forward view from the rear seats remains slightly restricted. Upon first impression, the electric door is clever as well as fun. You'll be tempted to smugly impress friends by opening the door with the keyfob hidden in your pocket. And you can avoid getting trampled by the softball team after you open the door. But a process that's ponderously slow compared with manual operation. The 3.4-liter V6 that powers both the Venture and Trans Sport is smooth, accelerates moderately well in comparison with the other test vehicles, and matches the smaller Voyager four-cylinder's fuel economy on the highway. The GM duo's handling is downright sprightly compared with that of previous GM minivans. Feedback from the steering wheel is noticeably lacking, however, detracting a bit from the pleasure of highway driving. Against the new GM lineup, Ford's Windstar stands out as something of a one-man team. Offered as a single model with a 120.7-inch-wheelbase (the short-wheelbase variation is represented by the Mercury Villager), the Windstar offers two V6 engine options: a 3.0-liter 150-hp powerplant and a 3.8-liter 200-hp version. The Windstar is narrower than the Voyager and wider than the GM entries, but its rounded roofline costs interior space up high. The interior layout is simple and efficient, with comfortable seats and good visibility front and rear. The addition of a ceiling-mounted mirror expand the rear cargo area quickly. The new oversize driver's door, however, is only a stopgap substitute for a left-side slider. The door doesn't add much rear-seat access, and when it's opened to its first stopping point, there is less room to climb in or out than with a shorter door. This can be a problem in tight parking spaces. The new left-side sliding doors on the GM and Chrysler vans are superior, particularly if you often use them to stow packages or other cargo in the second row of seats. The highway feel is solid and the steering is precise, marred only by the steering wheel's habit of abruptly snapping back to center as you come out of a slow-speed turn. Our 200-hp test vehicle was the quickest of any in this group. The Windstar's ride is outstanding-cushiest of the lot, but at the expense of considerable body roll. This smoothness shows in the interior as well, such as in the slick operation of the electrical switches. the least power in the group-albeit at the lowest price-ended up showing class in the stretch. The new 150-hp four-cylinder is smooth, more powerful, and unobtrusive, handling at least an unloaded van with aplomb. The high-efficiency engine is worth considering if you frequently drive without cargo. Handling, with a relatively slow steering ratio, is sometimes ponderous, but the highway feel is solid and precise. A superior package and attractive, aerodynamic shape distinguish the Voyager. The seating is nicely contoured, airy, and comfortable. Thanks to the downward slope of the area forward of the instrument panel, the front view is expansive. A low beltline aids visibility to the side and rear. Photograph You can open the optional electric door (left on GM's minivans from afar by pressing a button on the keyfob. The door also can also be activated from the driver's seat or by a button near the door itself. The longwheelbase Pontiac Trans Sport (right) has more cargo room than the short-wheelbase model, now has an expanded driver'sside door for a bit of additional access to the rear seats. Interior features include an overhead console that comes with a fold-down, panoramic rear-view mirror mounted in the ceiling (above), which allows you to see what the kids are doing in the back. That is, if you really want to know. // The aforementioned left-side door set a welcome trend when it was introduced. The trademark rear seat, which can be moved forward and backward, is the easiest full-size rear seat to remove completely. The middle seat is removable as well. The extra width is welcome, although Chrysler manages its edge in passenger volume at the expense of rear cargo room in the short-wheelbase version. That's one reason for the popularity of the stretch. Slightly smaller and slightly more expensive than the other vans in our test group, the Venture and Trans Sport are dramatic additions to GM's minivan fleet. The flexibility provided by the various seating arrays helps these minivans stand out. Handling Chrysler still holds advantages in design and interior room, while Ford has the plushest ride and the tightest interior assembly work. The spread between these minivans has thus narrowed to become more a matter of taste than of superiority. The car-like handling, combined with the best use of interior space and the laundry list of convenience features virtually unmatched by any other vehicle type, may not offset the current infatuation with oversize and overweight sport-utilities. But when logic and practicality count, the minivan more than manages to hold its own. //
"THERE IS NO MORE wonderful moment than when you realize you have just invented something that will win the Nobel prize," says biotechnology pioneer Kary B. Mullis, who was driving down a dark, country road when he suddenly thought of a way to make copies of DNA molecules. His method, called the polymerase chain reaction, has since been used for everything from tracing human evolution to identifying bloodstains at the O.J. Simpson trial. In most cases, though, inventions are born not of a Eureka moment but after years of trial and error, often building on the work of earlier inventors. So it was with Thomas Alva Edison, who perfected the light bulb and the phonograph in his Menlo Park, New Jersey, laboratory (where he kept POPULAR SCIENCE on the shelves). One of America's most prolific inventors, Edison was the first person to be inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio. A few months ago, Mullis and Alfred Nobel (whose invention of dynamite helped fund the prize that is named after we approach the year 2000, we are surrounded by more inventors and inventions than ever before. The U.S. Patents and Trademarks Office received more than 250,000 patent applications in the past year alone. To commemorate a millennium of technological discovery, the editors of POPULAR SCIENCE have chosen the 100 inventions that have had the greatest impact on our lives. We'll be bringing them to you throughout 1999. We begin this month with aerospace inventions that have taken humans beyond the bounds of Earth. In future months, we'll cover inventions in medicine, electronics, transportation, and other fields. We celebrate the inspiration and perspiration that have brought these great ideas to life. 1903 Airplane FOR CENTURIES, humans could only dream of soaring through the air like birds. But today so many people are flying that air traffic controllers are needed to prevent midair collisions. And because of airplanes, our world has become much smaller: We can now travel from one side of the planet to the other in a matter of hours around the turn of the century; most were spectacularly unsuccessful. But on December 17, 1903, brothers Orville and Wilbur Wright achieved the first powered, sustained, and controlled flight of an airplane, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. To create their Flyer, the brothers built a glider in their Dayton, Ohio, bicycle shop, and then designed an engine and propellers for it. The 12-horsepower motor turned two chains, which drove the twin propellers in opposite directions. On its first flight, the airplane covered 120 feet in 12 seconds. One decade and thousands of flights after his first, Orville wrote: aI would hardly think today of making my first flight on a strange machine in a 27-mile wind, even if I knew that the machine had already been flown and was safe. After these years of experience, I look with amazement upon our audacity in attempting flights. 1981 Space Shuttle NASA'S SPACE SHUTTLE is the world's first reusable spacecraft. It takes off like a rocket (the record is 279 orbits), and then lands on a runway just like an airplane. As of November 1998, five shuttles had flown a total of 93 missions. The shuttle has made it much easier for astronauts to live and work in space. 1939 Helicopter ALTHOUGH Leonardo da Vinci sketched a "whirlybird" in 1483, and the first primitive helicopter flew in 1907, it wasn't until 1939 that Igor I. Sikorsky built the world's first true production helicopter, the VS-300. Because of its ability to take off vertically and hover, the helicopter has proved invaluable for life-saving rescue missions. 1939 Jet Engine LONG-DISTANCE trips are now common, but such globetrotting wouldn't be possible without the jet engine, which produces forward motion by the rearward discharge of a hot gas. Germany's Heinkel HE 178 was the first plane powered by a jet engine; it flew in 1939. Jet planes entered commercial service in the early 1950s. 1957 Satellite THE SOVIET launch of Sputnik 1 (right), the space race. Today, some 500 commercial, military, and research satellites circle our planet. Among their tasks: relaying TV signals, keeping an eye on the weather, and sending spy photos to intelligence agencies. 1609 Optical Telescope NO OTHER TOOL has provided more clues about how our universe began, and how it may end. The telescope has enabled humans to gaze deep into space at stars, planets, comets, and other celestial objects. Galileo's first telescope was a simple tube, but today's instruments include huge ground-based observatories like the Keck Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope (above). 1971 Interplanetary Probe SINCE THE EARLY 1970s, the United States and Russia have launched a series of small unmanned spacecraft intended to explore other planets. Some of these craft have flown past faraway worlds and sent back pictures that provide clues about our solar system. Other probes, like the Mars Pathfinder and its rover (above), have descended to a planetary surface to take measurements. 1908 Rocket but it was Robert Hutchings Goddard who pioneered modern rocketry, building his first experimental projectiles in 1908. Rockets have proved valuable as weapons, and have made it possible to propel all sorts of objects to high altitudes. It was a multistage rocket that put men on the moon.)

Let's assume the new space vision proceeds apace and that construction of the International Space Station is completed around 2010. Let's say that NASA and its international partners then continue to operate the station for another seven years, as planned, using it mainly for human physiology experiments that investigate how we might handle extended interplanetary exploration. Meanwhile, of course, we'll have developed a new Crew Exploration Vehicle; heck, for the sake of argument, let's say we've even started dispatching robotic freighters to stock a site near the Moon's south pole for a permanent base. It's 2017, and it's time to turn our attention resolutely toward manned trips to the Moon -- and, beyond, to Mars. It's time (past time, many critics would say) to dump the ISS. What then? elephant into the world's most exclusive hotel. The ISS, after all, isn't an extraordinarily successful, irreplaceably valuable space telescope like the Hubble; you can't just discard it. Even in 13 years, it'll still be blessed with immense **27;3311;TOOLONG capabilities, high-volume data links and extensive collections of scientific instruments -- not to mention that golden attribute of all desirable real estate: location, location, location. This thing is an asset. Yet it's doubtful that NASA, even with pressure from its European and other space partners, will have the stomach or the budget to extend the station's life past its 2017 expiration date. Hence the hotel idea -- sell or lease the ISS to a gazillionaire, perhaps a Paul Allen, a Russian oligarch or a megacorporation with enough capital to finance the project. Citizen stays on the ISS are nothing new, of course. Later this year or early next, an as yet unidentified American physicist will become the third space tourist to pay $20 million not talking about enabling the fantasies of glorified stowaways, however abundantly wealthy. We're talking about converting the station from a sparse research lab into an entertainment center, complete with activities and amenities that are suitable for the discerning traveler and that maximize the touristic potential of weightlessness, and then throwing open the airlock doors to anyone with enough cash to pay for a stay. Even this plan is not wholly original. Proposals for independent space hotels pop up all the time (see "Spin City," opposite), and a dedicated hotel in low Earth orbit, whether it's a retrofitted space station or not, is the obvious extension of the business plan for space-tourism outfits like ISS tour broker Space Adventures, and even for the teams competing for the X Prize, which goes to the first private effort to launch a three-person spacecraft to an altitude of 62.5 miles and repeat the feat within two weeks. But we are the first to commission a drool-worthy, photo-real proof-of-concept depiction of a tourism-optimized space station did the financial and logistical reality check, to see what the bill would be and how the hotelnauts would get there and back. Skeptics might object that the timetable and other assumptions laid out at the beginning of this article (derived from the Bush space plan) are optimistic. They are. But if those assumptions aren't realized, the chorus for unloading the station even earlier will only grow louder. NASA will, sooner or later, having poured in more or less money, endeavor to forfeit its stake in the station. Here, then, is how the hotel scenario would work: A private consortium of some sort -- working in cooperation with the Russian, European and Japanese space agencies -- takes a long-term lease and invests in a major rehab (the Japanese and European research labs will continue to be used for research by a small team of scientists, assisted by inquisitive tourists). The consortium guts many of the existing American and Russian modules and adds a few new ones, including a also includes external screens for advertising, along with dedicated cameras inside and out for shooting space-based reality shows, all of which requires multiple flights on a spacecraft big enough to carry significant payloads to orbit. This brings us to our biggest hurdle: transportation. Today, the only spacecraft capable of transporting both passengers and modules to the ISS is the aging space shuttle, which costs $500 million per launch and is scheduled for decommission by 2010. The 1960s-vintage Russian Soyuz, currently the only other spacecraft that can transport people to the station, can hold either three astronauts or a limited amount of cargo, but not both. But solutions are on the way. Russia recently announced its plan to build a vehicle called Kliper, which evolved from a concept first proposed about 15 years ago. Kliper would be able to carry as many as six people up to the ISS. At the same time, the Chinese are planning more flights of their Shenzhou vehicle, an advanced version of the Soyuz. And then there future generations of the winning X Prize craft will soar high enough to reach low Earth orbit, and it would be silly not to design them to link up to Hotel Alpha, as we have dubbed our ISS resort. Whichever option emerges as the optimal ISS passenger-and-payload ferry will need to have a per-launch cost of around $10 million, or about one-fiftieth that of a space shuttle flight today. This is a back-of-the-envelope projection of annual operating costs: $100 million paid to Russian Mission Control for ground support; $300 million to NASA for ground support, including fabrication of spare parts for maintenance, as necessary; $50 million for additional logistics support; $50 million for supplies, payroll and other miscellaneous expenses. Add the cost of the launches -- approximately 20 per year -- and space hotel expenditures will total $700 million a year. How does the revenue stack up? Figure, conservatively, 60 paying customers at $12 million per week, for a total of $720 million. Then add in profits from station-related advertising and the station's immense power-generation capabilities, the ISS will be able to beam its surplus energy via microwave antennas to satellites in geosynchronous orbit. All told, the station could easily gross around $900 million a year, creating $200 million in annual profits for investors daring enough to transform it. What makes an ISS vacation worth the $12 million price tag? At root is the "because it's there" aspect: a thrilling journey, followed by bragging rights wrapped up in spectacular views. But once you're there, the big attraction will be something no Earthbound destination can provide: sustained weightlessness. Visitors will float through their stays as they gaze out upon the 16 sunrises and sunsets per Earth day. Modules will be reconfigured for microgravity activities, like six-wall handball, or bouncing around inside a giant tubular trampoline, or "eagling," in which visitors strap on wings and fly through a computer-generated environment depicting -- well, whatever they want. Passengers will also have the opportunity to sign up for the to stay attached to either the tram that runs up and down the station's long external truss, or to a robot arm added to the station's exterior. The consortium might even offer a once-per-stay space bungee jump, in which the space-suited guest is belayed out two miles on a tether for several hours of day-night planetary passes with nothing in sight but Earth and the cosmos, the station no bigger than a Matchbox car off in the distance. Even after remodeling, the Hotel Alpha will be better suited to the kind of adventure traveler who dreams of scaling Everest than to the pampered priss accustomed to room service. Guests won't be allowed to bring their own clothes, which could contaminate the sterile environment in the ISS with anything from cat dander to dry-cleaning chemicals. Nor will they be able to pack appliances: An ordinary alarm clock, for example, would fry aboard the ISS, because there are no convection currents to carry away air heated by the clock's electronics. Every appliance built for those fans add up to a noisy environment: 72 decibels on the ISS, about the level you hear on a freeway at 60 mph with the windows down. Another potentially disappointing reality: It will be extremely difficult, and potentially impossible, to earn charter membership in the 250-mile-high club. First, there's the tricky matter of weightless motion; coupling in such an environment might not be possible without a push from a third party (which is how some whales mate), or, at the very least, some well-placed handgrips. But more crucially, it's possible that men will have difficulity maintaining erections in microgravity. Then again, some guests might have a hard time getting in the mood anyway, what with all the barfing going on. Roughly half of all space travelers have experienced some degree of nausea, most likely caused by fluid floating around in the inner ear, which signals the body that it's in free fall. A Japanese journalist whose TV broadcasting company sent him to the throwing up. We're confident that the unique attractions of a space hotel will more than compensate for the inevitable hardships, keeping Hotel Alpha profitable for years to come. This profit motive, let's not forget, is the essential ingredient in our plan. From it will spring the opportunity to transform the ISS from a boondoggle into something that truly captures our Earthbound imaginations. "Looking back on it 20 or 30 years later," says Eric Anderson, president of Space Adventures, "people might say one of the most unexpected yet important outcomes of the ISS was that it became a place for the rest of us to experience space."

. The first reactor-on-a-barge will bring power to Russia's electricity-starved Arctic. WHILE THE U.S. hems and haws over reviving nuclear energy as a less expensive alternative to oil, Russia has dug back 30 years in our nuclear history to find a solution for some of its own energy woes: the floating nuclear power plant. The Russian nuclear-energy company Rosenergoatom is planning a mobile plant to deliver electricity to hard-to-reach northern territories near the White Sea, where harsh weather makes regular coal and oil fuel deliveries unreliable and expensive. The $200-million floating plant -- slated for construction next year -- could provide relatively inexpensive, reliable electricity to 200,000 people. Although the concept of a waterborne nuke plant might sound outlandish, it isn't new, nor did it originate in Russia. Westinghouse Electric Company considered the idea in the 1970s and built an immense dry-dock facility in Jacksonville, Florida, where plants would be launched and floated north along the Eastern Seaboard, conveniently doling out power to towns in need. Engineers would be able to standardize construction for multiple plants in an offsite factory with increased to its port of call. But ultimately, says retired Westinghouse consultant Richard Orr, energy conservation following the 1973 OPEC oil embargo killed the project. The Russian plan is to mount two reactors on a football-field-size barge, float it to a port, connect power lines to the mainland, and turn on the reactors, providing communities with affordable electricity. The plant will store waste and spent fuel in an onboard facility that workers will empty every 10 to 12 years during regular maintenance overhauls. After 40 years, the normal life span for a nuclear plant, the decommissioned plant would be towed away and replaced with a new one. The reactor and spent fuel would go to a storage facility, but the barge could be recycled. Yet because the safety of the Russian facility is still unknown, the prospect of resurrecting the Westinghouse idea in the White Sea has drawn protest from environmental groups such as Greenpeace and the Norwegian foundation Bellona. One concern is that a boat could ram the plant and spill waste into nasty storm could cut the plant off from the land-based power supply required to run plant operations. Should emergency generators fail, says David Lochbaum, director of the Nuclear Safety Project at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a Chernobyl-like disaster could ensue. In a worst-case scenario, an overheated core could melt through the bottom of the barge and drop into the water, creating a radioactive steam explosion. Such a cloud could do far more damage than the plume of nuclear fallout kicked up by the 1986 explosion of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the former U.S.S.R., Lochbaum notes, because the human body absorbs radioactive water droplets more easily than it does radioactive ash. "Its worst day would be much worse than a land power plant's," he says. Sergey Obozov, acting director for Rosenergoatom, says that reactors at sea have a proven safety record: The facility would be powered by two 60-megawatt KLT-40S reactors adapted from those already in use on three Russian nuclear-powered icebreakers. Yet Cristina Chuen, a Russian California, cautions that subtle performance differences might arise when running the reactor for pure energy generation instead of propulsion, noting that the cooling system remains unproven. Although the technology exists to contain a burning core, Rosenergoatom won't say if the plant -- which was designed a decade ago -- will include the most modern safety measures. With a building permit in hand, Rosenergoatom aims to have the facility afloat in the port city of Severodvinsk in the southeastern White Sea by late 2010 "The Russians have learned a lot about safety from the U.S. Department of Energy, Sweden and Norway -- who probably all wish the Russians would focus on things other than a floating nuclear power plant," says Chuen, who adds that she wishes the planning process were more transparent. "Maybe it will turn out great, but I just hope they did all the research to make sure it's safe."

Here are two quick-to-build woodworking projects that will come in especially handy this time of year. The portable workbench is great to use as a tool holder and seat for easy, no-kneel, low-level gardening such as weeding or harvesting bush beans. And the canning shelves will hold sparkling jars of your garden's bounty. A PORTABLE WORKBENCH Whether you are a contractor who builds everyday or a banker who fixes around the house on weekends, the portable, easy-to-build tool bench will allow you to tote everything you need for a task, while providing a perfect seat. MATERIAL A light, durable wood like pine or poplar should be used for constructing the bench. You may already have scrap from another project suitable for this one, but if you don't, you will have to purchase only two boards -- one 1" X 6" X 14' board and one 1" X 4" X 6' board; 1-1/4" drywall screws are ideal for holding the bench together; a half-pound will be adequate for the job. Any building supply will be not familiar with buying lumber there is a fact you need to know. Planed (dressed) lumber will be slightly smaller than the measurements it is listed as and unplanned (rough) lumber will run slightly larger. For instance, a 1" X 6" dressed board will actually measure about 3/4" X 5". For this project, that slight difference will not matter. Simply follow the directions provided here and the tool bench will turn out correctly. CUTTING On the 1" X 6" X 14' board, using a square, mark two 24" lengths, two 22" lengths, and four 18" lengths. On the 1" X 4" X 6' board, mark two 24" lengths and two 12" lengths. Cut out these lengths. One corner of each 1" x 6" X 18" board needs to be cut off at a diagonal to create the legs for the bottom of the bench. Choose a corner, measure along one edge 4" from that same corner along the other edge and make a mark Use a straight edge to draw a line connecting these two marks and then cut along this line, removing the corner from the board. The top of the bench will have a hole cut into it as a carrying handle. Along one side of each of the two 1" X 6" X 24" s make a mark in the center. Measure and mark 2-1/2" on either side of the middle mark on the edge of the boards. Then measure in 1" from the edge at the high and low marks and make marks. Ignore the first center mark and use a straightedge to connect the other four marks on each board, making a 1" X 5" rectangle. Cut out these rectangles with a jigsaw or by making multiple 1" -deep saw cuts within the rectangles and knocking: out the small chunks. When put together on top of the bench they will make a 2" X 5" 4" X 12" s and rip each board in half, making four 1" X 2" X 12" strips. ASSEMBLY On a flat surface, lay two of the 1" X 2" X 12" strips you have just ripped. Across these strips lay two of the 1" X 6" X 18" boards with their cutoff corners facing each other. Align one strip along the top edge of both pieces and screw it securely there, using two screws per board. The quickest way to screw the pieces together is using a Phillip's-head screwdriver bit in a variable-speed drill. Next, position the bottom strip 4-1/4" up from the bottom and screw it into place. Repeat this procedure with the other two 1" X 2" X 12" strips and 1" X 6" X 18" end boards. Next take the two 1" X 6" X 22" boards, place them flush against the end boards on top of the strips you just mounted, strips. Place the 1" X 6" X 24" boards on top of the bench, align them flush with the end boards, and screw them into place. Be sure to put the precut handle notches together in the center of the top. Finally, position the two 1" X 4" X 24" boards along the sides, even with the bottom of the 1" X 6" X 22" boards, completing the tool tray, and screw them into place (two screws at each end and three spaced along the bottom). Your tool bench is complete! Gather the tools you need for a particular job in the tray, tote the stool to the site, and you can sit on it and work, stand on it to reach higher places, or use the bench to saw or chisel on. SHOW OFF YOUR COLORFUL CANNED GOODS If you take pride in canning summer produce, then this easy-to-build, inexpensive set of shelves may be just right for you. a large amount of storage while allowing the colorful harvest goods to be shown off. And it makes keeping inventory a snap. The only tools necessary for completing this project are a circular saw, a carpenter's square, a tape measure, a chalk line, a hammer, and a pencil. The materials list is equally straightforward: seven 1" X 6" X 8' boards and 1/2-pound of 12d nails. I approached this project as a rustic country pantry shelf, so I purchased roughcut pine lumber. If you prefer a more refined looking shelf then you may purchase dressed lumber from your local building supply. Pine or poplar should be available just about anywhere and are very good woods for this project, being light, durable, and very easy to work with. Also, you may go as far as sanding and finishing your shelves, but I just kept mine simple and rustic. LAYOUT AND CUTTING Choose two 8' boards for the side pieces. Take one of these boards and a square (90deg) end. If neither end is square, then come down approximately 2" from an end, draw a 90deg line using the square, and cut along this line making a square end. Pull your tape measure from this end and make a small mark at 5' 11". Take the carpenter's square and draw a 90deg line right at the mark you just made. Cut along the line. You should now have one 1" X 6" X 5' 11" board with two square ends. Repeat this process on the other board you chose for a side board so that you have two 1" X 6" X 5' 11" square-ended boards. The next step is basically the same as above, only the cut boards are smaller for shelf use. Choose four 1" X 6" X 8' boards from the remaining pile. Pick a board and try to find a square end. If neither end is square, repeat the above your tape measure from the square end and make a mark at 3' 9" Draw the 90deg line and cut along that line: Now pull your tape measure from the end you just cut on the remaining piece, make a mark at 3' 9", draw a 90deg line, and cut along that line. You should end up with two 1" X 6" X 3' 9" shelf boards with square ends and a little kindling. Repeat this process for the remaining three shelf boards you chose so there are a total of seven 1" X 6" X 3' 9" shelf boards with square ends. Take the length of board (approximately 4' 3") remaining from the last shelf you cut and mark a 45deg line as dose as possible to one end. Measure 14" along the edge of the board from the point where the line is closest to the end of the board and make a small mark. Draw a 45deg line back toward the and the lines taper to about 3". Cut along these lines. Repeat this process once again. These are two upper-corner brackets that both give the shelves stability and provide a place to nail the unit to a wall. Finally, you will need to knock out some simple safety strips that will keep the jars from falling out the front of the shelves in the event they are jostled. The remaining board will be ripped into four 1-1/2" strips. At each end of the board make marks at 1-1/2", 3", and 4-1/2". Stretch the chalk line taut between corresponding marks and then snap lines. If you are working alone, a nail temporarily driven at one end of the board on a mark will provide you the extra hand needed to hold one end of the string. Rip along these lines with a circular saw so that you end up with four 1" X 1-1/2" X 8' strips. Choose a strip and check for a square end; make a. Pull your tape measure from the square end and mark at 3' 11". Make a square line and cut along that line. Pull the tape measure from the cut just made along the remaining piece, mark at 3' 11", draw a line, and cut. Repeat this for the remaining four strips until you have a total of six 1" X 1-1/2" X 3' 11" strips. You now have cut all the pieces necessary to build the shelves. ASSEMBLY Assembly begins by nailing the four pieces together that create the outer rectangular shape of the shelves. Have your hammer and nails ready. On the floor, stand up on edge the top piece (a 1" X 6" X 3' 9") and a side piece (a 1" X 6" X 5' 11"). Bring the top piece along flush to the top of the side piece so that the end grain of the side piece remains exposed and that of the side piece into the top piece using three nails (front, middle, and back). Repeat this procedure with the other side piece and a bottom (another 1" X 6" X 3' 9"). Bring the two pieces together so they make a rectangle -- be sure to align them so that the end grain of the longer side pieces remains exposed and that of the shelf pieces is covered by the sides -- and nail using three nails per connection as described. Use the carpenter's square at each corner of the rectangle to make sure they are square. If the rectangle is not square, gently move the unit until it becomes square and then proceed. Measure down from the bottom of the top shelf along one side and make a small mark at 11-3/4". Repeat this along the other side. Use the square and a pencil to make a 90deg line through these marks by putting the long edge of the square along the floor next to the side board (make aligning with the surface of the side board.) Fit a shelfboard into the rectangle so that its top surface runs exactly between the two lines you have just drawn. Nail the shelf in place. Measure down 10-3/4" from the bottom of the newly installed shelf and repeat the above procedure. It will be 10-3/4" from the bottom of one shelf to the top of the next shelf. Finally, install the safety strips. Measure up 2-1/2" from the top of each shelf along both sides and make small marks. Align the bottoms of the strips between the marks and nail them there using only two nails per strip, one nail per side. Flip the whole unit over so the safety strips are down. Take one of the two remaining braces and position it in a top corner so that its 45deg edges align with the top and side of the shelf unit. Nail it in place with two nails at each end. Repeat this procedure with the other brace on the other top corner wall (with the safety strips facing the room, of course). It will need to be fastened to the wall because, even if the shelving unit is full, the weight of the jars will make them top heavy and prone to falling over. I used one nail through each bracket into the wall. If your wall is Sheetrock you will have to either nail through the braces into studs, or find one of many Sheetrock-fastening gizmos available at most hardware stores. Your canning-jar shelves are complete and ready to fill. It will hold 60 half-gallon mason jars or 90 quarts and you can pile your cookbooks on top between bookends. For simplicity, low cost, efficient use of space, safe storage of jars, and easy food inventory, the mason-jar shelves are a great addition to any pantry.
One of the only noticeable differences between the car of today and the car of my childhood is that these days I can never get the darn window down; there are too many little button controls all over. I don't consider this a real improvement. While today's car is capable of locking it self, turning off its own lights, and cooling its interior, adding on more amenities has only succeeded in making the car more complicated. Adding on amenities hasn't done much for fuel efficiency and overall design either, and there's a whole pack of Americans who'd rather drive an old car than a new one, if for no other reason than they like to keep some things-like rolling down a window or changing the oil-within the realm of human abilities. It's hard to imagine, with the runawaytrain progression of technological advances in computers, electronics, and synthetic materials, how Detroit will be able to continue rolling out new models based on old designs in the 21st century. There is an increasingly popular theory incubating in places like universities foreign) auto manufacturers that the technology of cars is no longer applicable to cars. Let's just imagine Detroit's worst nightmare for a minute: What if a consortium of high-tech computer and electronics manufacturers and leaders from the aerospace and sporting goods industries pooled their intellectual and physical resources to redesign the car from the ground up? What materials would they use, and what structure would they use? What operating systems and fuel system would they use? What kind of car would it be? As it turns out, these questions are no longer hypothetical. Scientists at the Rocky Mountain Institute in Snowmass, Colorado are in the final stages of organizing a consortium of high-tech manufacturers to make real a concept they have developed called "the hypercar." It will be a hybrid electric vehicle, combining the power of a conventional internal combustion engine with an electric motor powered by batteries having four to five times the capacity of today's standard car battery. It will be made of polymer composites rather than steel, in its best design of getting somewhere around 200 MPG in traffic. The design of the car is a flexible one, based solely on what industries decide is most efficient. Rocky Mountain Institute research associate Michael Brylawski sums up the hypercar concept: "The key to the hypercar is it combines these ultrasafe, ultrastrong materials that are light for fuel efficiency with a hybrid electric drive system in a very slippery, aerodynamic package." Rocky Mountain Institute's engineers see a day very soon when owning a car will be a lot like owning a personal computer. You will not buy a new car as often as you might "upgrade" your old car, adding software, doubling your capacity, and so on. This upgradable car made of light materials will be easy to reuse and recycle. The overall environmental benefits will be great but are almost a fringe benefit of a more efficient design. According to the philosophy of the Rocky Mountain Institute, the point is not to make an "eco-car." In addition to developments in technology, recent policy initiatives have created a hospitable climate for the hypercar concept to become a reality. Automakers are now preparing to meet the requirements of President Clinton's Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, a joint government-industry project that requires the Big Three domestic automakers to design affordable vehicles that get up to 80 MPG by the year 2003. California has also passed a law requiring 10 percent of the vehides in the state to be zero-emissions vehicles by 2003. The hypercar would qualify as zero emissions equivalent in a new category currently being considered by the California Resources Board. (If adopted, the category would only apply to California at this point.) Rocky Mountain Institute hopes that the hypercar demonstration project, built by the consortium, can have an impact on the way the car industry responds to these government edicts. Without mentioning the names of hightech companies who have begun devoting resources to the demonstration hypercar, RMI scientists predict the consortium is on the verge of beginning construction. of the American automobile industry, cars based on the hypercar concept will likely be on the market within 5-10 years. The Rocky Mountain Institute is a notfor-profit think tank near Aspen that develops market-oriented solutions to environmental problems. Their offices, in the highly resource-efficient home of founders Hunter and Amory Lovins, are a working model of sustainable living. With 16-inch thick foam-filled stone masonry walls, double-paned argon gas-filled windows, and a small solar panel system, the Lovins's heating fuel for the entire winter in the snowy, cold, high Rockies is a half a cord of firewood. The place is warm enough to support tropical plants including bananas, grapes, guava, and papaya, and is a working demonstration of hightech devices-from the washing machine to the light bulbs-for sustainable living. While visiting RMI, I sat down with three of the institute's scientists who have been working on the development of the hypercar concept. We held a round table discussion about the barriers to and the possibilities for developing a better car Mike perched atop some -ted, but gorgeous technology. // Michael Brylawski is the research associate for advanced-composites manufacturing economics. David Cramer is the senior research associate for materials and manufacturing. Dr. Jonathan Fox is the senior research associate for emissions, air quality, and transportation. MOTHER EARTH NEWS: What are the barriers that have kept manufacturers from applying new technology to develop more efficient automobiles? CRAMER: Automakers are very conservative, technologically. No automaker is willing to move as fast as technology would allow, due to cultural inhibitions. BRYIAWSI: The reason that you don't see the technological change-even though the technology is available, and can be implemented if energy is put that way-is that the automakers are very used to making a certain type of car that uses steel as its main material, is internal combust-has an internal combustion engine-with gasoline as its fuel. And, they have over seven decades of experience and refinement in this technology so it's very comfortable... very familiar. And the level of refinement is build these cars is so great, that it's very difficult to switch over tomorrow and say: We're going to start building hypercars. There's so much what they call "cultural inertia" in the automakers to prevent that. Photograph // CRAMER: Also, you have to think, in the past 20 years there have been many different consumer desires and policy changes that have incrementally pushed cars a certain way. MEN: Environmental policies? CRAMER: Environmental policies, crash-safety standards, just people wanting more air conditioning-air conditioning is a standard in vehicles-these sorts of amenities. And the way that's been handled is by, if they want an air conditioner, you add air conditioning. But you don't change how the whole, you know, climate control system is. You're still making the same car, but you're just adding an air conditioner. So it's tended to make cars heavier, more expensive, less fuel efficient. FOX: One of these barriers has been the that the higher-end cars, that happen to be less efficient, generally subsidize the lower-end cars. So the Ford Escort may have never made a dollar for Ford-but the bigger cars that they make have a much higher profit margin in them. It essentially subsidizes the more efficient, smaller lighter cars. FOX: Right. So, we think we'll see many different types of players trying to enter the automotive market. MEN: New car companies? FOX: Potentially new car companies. Maybe a consortium or two, some computer manufacturers, and maybe even some traditional automotive manufacturers from foreign countries, that aren't as committed with their resources to the steel-stamping industry that is so prevalent in this country. MEN: I think it's kind of interesting what you said earlier about the car industry not being willing to take a blank slate look at redesigning the car. But the electric vehicle almost is that to too much of an extent. A hybrid is almost an amendment to the regular car, as Your car has batteries and a fuel system just like today's cars. BRYLAWSKI: To the consumer, but not to the producer. I mean, to GM, this is... MEN: This is a totally new manufacturing process? CRAMER Yes, in fact, it's even more of an issue with design. An electric car-it seems like when people design an electric car, they say, "Let's start from a clean sheet and build an electric car." But if you say, "If we start from a clean sheet and just build a car," then what do you get? Well, we think you get a hypercar. BRYLAWSKI: And most electric cars today are basically conventional cars that they've stripped out conventional processes and put in batteries. FOX: Except for the EV- 1, which would be an incredible car if it wasn't carrying around that mass of batteries. MEN: So what happened to this wave of electric vehicles? Now they're switching going to pay $25,000 to buy an electric car? BRYLAWSKI: At least $25,000. FOX: Yeah, that's one of the fundamental problems with electric cars, is that they're more expensive and they don't provide the same functionality as today's cars. So they're relegated to being niche vehicles. And that's one of the fundamental differences between the hypercar concept, if it comes to fruition, is that it can have widespread availability in the market. MEN: Because it's going to be cheaper. FOX: The goal will be to be cheaper but, actually, because it'll be a better car. It'll provide all of the same attributes that users want today and meet the ones they'll want tomorrow-such as improved safety, and amenities, and also range. That's where the electric cars fall off is range, and also subtle environmental problems like battery recycling and disposal. When you have 1,500 pounds of batteries, it's a huge mass that you have to been working correctly. And there's no real experience how well they're going to work. BRYLAWSKI: The main issue with that is that battery vehicles do have emissions: they come from power plants. We call them "elsewhere-emissions vehicles." The emissions that you could get at the tailpipe of a hypercar aggregated could be less than a battery-electric car even under the cleanest scenarios. MEN: How quickly do you think hypercar technology will be incorporated into marketable automobiles? BRYLAWSKI: It depends on what kind of a hypercar you're talking about because they're all different. "Hypercar" is just a concept; it's not a specific technology. So some of the near-term hypercars won't get the 200-mile-per-gallon figures-maybe more towards 80-and they won't have fuel cells which produce virtually no pollution. They may have a gas turbine. These cars could come out, we think, within a decade. FOX: And perhaps within five years. BRYLAWSKI: Because, for example, if you take GM hybrid, you'd have a two-seater hypercar. FOX: Pretty close to a hypercar. MEN: Is the EV-1 made out of light materials? FOX: It is made out of light materials, it's very aerodynamic... MEN: But it costs $34,000. FOX: The average price of a new car today is $22,000. The EV-1 is a niche vehide, two-seater sports car. It's priced about right for its class. MEN: So the first hybrid-electric are not going to be mass-produced, inexpensive cars? FOX: It's unlikely. I mean, it's more likely that they'll be the high-end cars, and it'll diffuse down rapidly because it'll be a simpler, cheaper way to make a batch of cars. BRYLAWSKI: It's generally the standard operating procedure of new technology CRAMER: One important thing about this is, we're not saying that this would be the first hypercar. Because automakers may have their own developments using these technologies. Ford's P2000 comes demonstration project will do is build a hypercar right. FOX: With our vision and with the resources we identified through multiple years of research as being the most viable technologies to go into this platform. And, really, the main focus is to demonstrate manufacturability of hypercars at a low cost. We know we can build one of anything. That's what this country is really good at. CRAMER: But can you make them at all competitive with existing products? MEN: And how far along are you in getting together a consortium for the demonstration project? FOX: We have very interested parties that haven't signed on any dotted lines but have committed resources to the project, such as engineers and materials. And many of these are materials that haven't been in the automotive market traditionally. So these players are very interested in opening up a new market for themselves. MEN: And are there some people who have been in the automotive industry? CRAMER Yes. MEN: Can you say time line for when that might happen? FOX: Our personal goal, in terms of the Hypercar Center, is to have the product finished early enough to have an influence in where the Original Equipment Manufacturers are going with their block programs and their project programs. The PNGV Partnership for the New Generation of Vehicles is trying to determine what are going to be the best technologies to produce an 80-mile-per-gallon car that the government has challenged them to do. FOX: The PNGV deadline is 2003, and they're rolled back one deadline already, so that's not etched in stone. But we'd like to be done far enough ahead of that so that we can have a positive influence in their thinking and the way they're viewing it, because they're getting dose to our line of thinking with this Ford car-the P2000which is essentially an aluminum aerodynamic lightweight vehicle. It's not as light as an advanced composite car could be. BRYLAWSKI: But the other thing about the demonstration vehicle, we're. Because what Jon said is very important-just as there was a lock-in on steel cars and internal-combustion engines, there may be a tendency to lock in the technology for the next generation of vehicles. For example, the materials competition, where you have steel, which is rapidly trying to shed its own mass due to design principles, aluminum, and the polymer industry, all fighting to become the dominant material in the new automobiles. And it may be tempting for automakers to lock into one choice. We emphasize composites, but we have specs. The hypercar, once again, is a concept and if a metal can achieve the safety and mass production requirements that a hypercar would need to be very efficient yet high-performance, all for the better, basically. FOX: Right. We're not wed to any one particular technology or material. MEN: So in the vehicle you designed, you don't name anything too specifically. CRAMER: Right. So sometimes people say, "Well, I... No, no, no, it's a concept; it's an approach to building cars." MEN: One of the main criticisms of designing an auto using light materials is the safety factor. Are we safer in bigger cars? CRAMER: Well, first of all, there's a big misconception there in that we're not talking about small cars; we're talking about light cars. And, you can have a car the size of a Ford Taurus that's half the mass, and you can have it be just as crashworthy because the materials that you'd use, and the way you'd design the car, can absorb energy just as well as the other car. FOX: But the other thing is, what's happening in the market today is this mass armament-type phenomenon, where sport-utility vehicles are becoming more and more popular. MEN: So would you consider this trend an obstacle to this idea? CRAMER: Well, it's also an obstacle to general Ford Expedition, then I might be making myself safer. BRYLAWSKI: But not necessarily. CRAMER: Not necessarily. But I'm also putting everyone else that I might hit, or who might hit me, at a higher risk because I'm putting them at a disadvantage. FOX: And the federal government recently acknowledged this, and there's talk of regulating the weight of sport-utility vehicles. Sport-utilities are heavy cars, but they're not very safe. They roll over very easily, and over half the accidents today that kill people are not collisions; they're single-car accidents. And so when you get these vehicles where people feel safe, they're driving faster than they shouldthey're actually exceeding the limits of the vehicles. So there's the notion of perceived safety, which is what makes you buy a big car, and then there's the actual safety. Does that big car absorb energy in a crash? Many of these big cars are so stiff that if they hit a very occupants. And that's much less safe then hitting it in a light car that's designed to absorb its own energy, so there's a lot of mitigating factors. BRYLAWSKI: We emphasize these technologies in the hypercar concept can be used to make a sport-utility car as well. MEN: A hyper-sports-utility? FOX: Yes, I mean, everything that people like in sport-utility vehicles-not just safety, but durability and ruggedness, and what have you-is part of the actual technology of the hypercars. For example, our electric drive system has very high torque at low speed. The application could be towing capacity or hill climbing. And composite materials are incredibly durable. If people really want big vehicles, you could have hyper-sports-utilities. FOX: And many traditional cars are being made with composites, as energy-absorbing elements, in their bumpers. So we're essentially building that into the car from the ground up, as opposed to adding it on. Photograph // MEN: Let's talk about the inherent good in a remote part of Colorado, I assume you guys do a lot of driving around... CRAMER: No, we bike everywhere. FOX: I own two cars, but 80% of my miles are on bicycle. MEN: There's some irony there, considering your life's work. If you feel you should ride your bike everywhere, wouldn't you also feel we should be working to encourage a less car-oriented society? BRYLAWSKI: We have two main philosophies on that. The first one is that hypercars solve two of the most major transportation-oriented problems, which are air and oil-oil security, the problems we've had in the Middle East, etc. Amory says it's basically like finding an OPEC under Detroit in terms of how much oil we could save if everybody had these technologies. And then, of course, air quality. MEN: But cars aren't the only way to solve those problems. CRAMER: Right. If everyone left their cars at home and weren't driving live in suburbs today, there's no way they can get to work when there's no infrastructure. MEN: So, we have to accept the prevalence of cars? FOX: In the short term. BRYLAWSKI: It isn't a panacea, but it can significantly help those two problems. And then it'll allow us to focus more effort on problems that it doesn't solve, in terms of equity and mobility and congestion. MEN: Another problem with cars is that they are largely responsible for urban sprawl. CRAMER: Well, the thing is, technology changes can occur relatively rapidly. Demographic shifts and changes in land use happen over decades. And if we can, within a decade, get the hypercar on the road and start helping the environment while, concurrently, RMI's Green Development program helps to rethink land-use planning and building design, and to promote resource-efficient living, then we start going to a larger system of transportation. It's a path to sustainability, but it also-when we look at how the United States exports its culture, so that the desires of other countries are really to have automobility-one thing we want is for them to leapfrog the development path that we took. MEN: You mean the Third World? FOX: Third World. China, as an example of a country that has tremendous economic wealth: they have a middle class of 200 million people that can afford to buy cars today. They just don't have' em-but they want them. BRYLAWSKI: The conventional automakers are putting their meat hooksthey're taking their obsolete technologies into these countries, their old tooling, their old technologies. FOX: That is not the path that we want them to go on. And they don't really want it, either. So we're saying: China, why don't you rethink this development path, and go right to a hypercar-based economy? Those are the kinds of low hanging fruit that really could make a transformation. I'm not saying that extent, they're going to be going with cars. And it might actually be with trucks so why not make hypertrucks for moving their agricultural products around China and many other developing countries, where trucking is actually 80% of their fuel consumption for farming and agriculture use. BRYLAWSKI: Some environmentalists have said: Well, if you take away the problems of the cars, you're going to have more cars; you're going to make cars perfect. But, we emphatically think that if you solve some of the problems, you can again focus your attention on other ones like congestion and land-use planning. FOX: Cars may be our enemies, but we see them as the means to getting to a point where we can rethink how we actually use them. MEN: Anything else you'd like to add? CRAMER: Just essentially what we're talking about is a car that if your average person walked into the dealership and saw the hypercar-it could be a hyper-Taurus, it could be a hyper-Suburban'd think it's a better car... whether they care about the environment or not. MEN: I might want one. BRYLAWSKI: We'll try to get you one in ten years. For more information about the Hypercar contact the Rocky Mountain Institute, 1739 Snowmass Creek Rd, Snowmass, CO 816549199.

An environmental checklist for new home buyers. Photograph // When we buy a car or a new computer, we often read consumer and specialty magazines to get the background information we need to make an informed decision. But when we buy land and a house-perhaps the most significant purchase that we make in our lives-the average American spends very little time on research. Usually we worry only about affordability or mortgage qualifications, and we don't stop to consider the environment we're buying into. At times, the environmental considerations of buying a home can even be more crucial than the purchase price. Asbestos ceilings and lead paint can lead to less-than -- healthy indoor air quality; and if your property lies in a floodplain or over a sinkhole, then you may be rebuilding sooner than you think. The following checklist will identify some fundamental considerations that you need to be aware of before you buy your next home. If you wait until after the purchase, it may be too late. BACK TO THE LAND FLOODPLAINS While a house near a tranquil river may seem your dream home into a disaster area. Even in areas of the country where streambeds are dry for significant portions of the year, a sudden rain can turn that streambed into a raging river. Do not be fooled by the size of the stream; even small ones can flood and cause considerable damage. The quickest way to find out whether or not land sits in a floodplain is by referencing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a government agency that publishes maps called Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM). They are available at state environmental agencies, county planning departments, and local, county and university libraries. If you purchase a house in a floodplain, make sure you obtain flood insurance, but as a general rule avoid buying houses in the 100- or 500-year floodplain of rivers or streams. WETLANDS Wetland areas, better known as swamps or bogs, can be covered with water all or only part of the year and should be avoided at all costs. If you come across a notice wet basements along with flooding or settling problems. In addition, since the federal and state governments regulate development in wetlands, it will be difficult-not to mention expensive and time-consuming-to obtain approval for construction. DRAINAGE AND HIGH WATER TABLES The most significant cause of flooding in basements, however, does not come from wetlands or traditional flooding from rivers and streams, but rather from poorly drained runoff or high water tables. Location, slope, vegetation and soils are all determining factors for runoff -- if not property managed, drainage can cause significant problems for homeowners. If you are at the top of a hill, for example, you have far less potential for problems than if you are at the base of a hill. When shopping for land, try to investigate the site while it's raining so you can check out its drainage systems. Thankfilly, drainage problems can often be resolved either by simple measures like cleaning the gutters and downspouts, or by more complex measures such as recontouring the land. But water that flows underground in the water table, which for some parts of the country is a significant seasonal problem. Thawing temperatures and spring rains can raise the level of water in the ground, and this water can seep into basements through cracks and joints. Unlike surface drainage, however, there is little that can be done to mitigate a high water table. Sump pumps can remove minor water table problems, but if it's too high you are usually better off in a house without a basement. STEEP SLOPES Where the grade of the land is greater than 12% to 15% (that is, where the land slopes upward 12 feet or more for every 100 feet of horizontal distance) it will be difficult to build a house, and there is a great likelihood that sod around the house will erode with any water gravitating downhill Steep slopes often result in mud and rockslides; very steep slopes in mountainous areas can result in landslides and avalanches of snow. These inclines have been a major pm in people like to build for the view. In these areas, mudslides are an all too common -- and disastrous -- occurrence. If you decide to build or buy on steep slopes, make sure that the house is either terraced or supported by stilts on concrete footers. Terracing is more expensive, but it provides the best support. Be aware, however, that neither method is without significant risks. Even though you may have a great view of the ocean, you don't want your house to end up in the drink, RADON United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) studies of radon, an odorless, colorless, radioactive gas that is a natural decay product of uranium in the soil, indicate that long-term, chronic exposure to high levels of the gas can cause lung cancer. And since it is found everywhere in varying concentrations, radon generally finds its way into homes through drain open, sump wells, cracks in the foundation floor or through cinder block walls. You can determine radon presence purchase of a house. If the test returns levels above 4 pCi/L (picocuries per liter) you should negotiate for remediation of the problem. Relatively inexpensive techniques such as crack sealing and radon ventilation are effective in solving low to medium radon levels, but high levels may require more expensive action. In this case, you may choose to pass on the house. INSECT AND PESTS Many people tend to forget that humans are not the only inhabitants of the earth; for some reason, we are surprised when insects invade our home. There are thousands of different types of inset in every part of the world, and mosquitoes, ants, spiders, wasps and moths, to name a few, will intrude upon us at will. While wasps and mosquitoes can ruin your picnic, these insects usually don't have the significant impact on your house that carpenter ants, carpenters bees and termites have. To those insects, your wooden house is simply another tree in which to nest and upon which to feed house for termite tunnels, and check any exposed areas for soft or rotted wood. Carpenter ants will usually deposit wood shavings and insect parts near these areas of "spongy wood." Carpenter bees usually leave round holes and tunnels in exposed wood. All can be taken care of by environmentally friendly insecticides, although be aware that many of these pests will return for another visit in the future. INDOOR SAFETY ASBESTOS AND LEAD Until the late 1970s, asbestos was commonly used as an insulation for attics, water- and sewer pipes, and as a material in the manufacture of ceiling tiles, vinyl floor tiles and roof shingles. Since then, scientific evidence has shown that asbestos fibers are a potential carcinogen, particularly for people who are constantly exposed to loose fibers over a prolonged period of time. Asbestos that is in good condition and is not deteriorating should be left alone. Removing it increases the potential for spreading fibers throughout the house and may pose more of a threat than leaving the insulation alone. Even stoves, door gaskets, pipe and attic insulation, wall and ceiling material, vinyl floor tiles and sheet flooring, textured paint, roofing, shingling, siding and appliances. If the material is in poor shape, consider either not buying the house or incorporating the cost of removing the asbestos in the purchase price. Asbestos removal requires a professional contractor who has been trained and, if appropriate, licensed by a state agency. This process is costly and requires extensive preparation. Similarly, if your house was built before 1978, the walls may have been painted with lead paint that can be toxic to adults and children when breathed in or swallowed. According to the EPA and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), children under age 6 who have been exposed to lead can develop learning and behavioral problems. Photograph // The presence of lead paint can be determined only by testing. The Residential Lead -- Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act requires that sellers of houses built before 1978 must disclose known in all 50 states, does not require sellers to repair or correct the problem. If the paint is in good condition, it can probably be painted or wallpapered over. If the house interior has been repainted during the last 15 years, you probably don't have to worry unless all of the paint is peeling or flaking. Improper removal of lead paint can produce paint chips, dust and fumes -- all of which can make you sick. In addition to paint, lead is usually present in the solder that connects the copper water distbution pipes. There are only two ways to deal with lead in this form: Replace all of the pipes with non-leaded soldered joints (a very expensive alternative), or filter your drinking water. Since heat encourages leaching, lead is more of a problem in the hot water supply pipes than the cold water pipes. Therefore, it is best not to use hot water for drinking or cooking. ELECTRO-MAGNETIC FIELDS There has been increasing concern about the potential health risks and distribution lines. Since 1979, scientific studies have suggested a potential relationship between exposure to EMFs and certain cancers. These studies, however, are far from conclusive, but most everyone agrees that the closer you are to the electro-magnetic field, the stronger the effects will be. Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what constitutes a "safe" level of exposure to EMFs. Nevertheless, for some the presence of electric transmission lines has become a legitimate concern. Some buyers, especially those with small children, will refuse the house outright. In response, the real estate market has reacted to concerns about the health risks of EMFs and prices of homes near large transmission lines have dropped dramatically, usually selling at a discount. To some this may mean more house for less, but beware: This discounting will also be around when it's time for you to sell. UNDERGROUND HAZARDS Sinkholes, underground mines, abandoned wells, forgotten oil tanks and hidden pollution are some of the hazards found on properties others may make you think twice before buying. SINKHOLES These areas occur when the surface soil collapses because the underlying soil or geology is either washed or eroded away Fortunately, sinkholes are rare; they usually occur either in areas where the underlying geology is composed of easily erodible material such as limestone or where the underlying soil is exposed to a high water table. Avoid areas where sinkholes have been previously recorded, since it's impossible to predict accurately when another will occur. ABANDONED MINES Tradition has it that when ore was exhausted from a mine, the tunnels were abandoned and no one was left behind to maintain the site. As a result, water seeped into shafts and undermined support timbers, causing them to rot and fall apart. Mine walls also shifted as the subsurface geology changed; in some coal mining areas, abandoned mines even caught fire. As a result, the land that is directly over mines can sink, or even catch fire. ABANDONED WELLS Photograph Check for tunnels or rotten wood when will treat a foundation like just another meal. // Although relatively rare, abandoned wells are discovered on properties from time to time. The principal concern with these is safety because there have been incidents of animals and even small children falling into and becoming trapped in abandoned well shafts. (Who can forget the highly publicized rescue of little Jessica McClure from an abandoned well in Midland, Texas in 199P) To be certain, some states keep records of wells that are dug, but since most of the problem wells are very old, the only sure way to determine if there is one on your property is to walk the property and look for evidence before you purchase. OIL TANKS Underground oil tanks may be present either on the property or in the basement of an older house or a house in a rural area. Older tanks, particularly tanks underground, will rust and leak over time posing not only an economic c but also health conceres by affecting your drinking water supplies. if you find one on determine the age of the tank, since this will be a good indication of the potential for problems. Also, consider moving underground tanks indoor so that you can monitor them for future problems. PESTICIDES AND HERBICIDES If you are building or buying a house on an old farm or near a working farm, there is a potential for pesticide contamination in the soil. Farmers use an array of chemicals to control pests and weeds; these can enter the soil or a well by direct runoff, through local streams, through underground water flows, or as a result of past improper disposal. The only way to know whether your soil or your drinking water is contaminated is to have it tested. As a rule of thumb, it may be best to pass on the purchase of any site that contains significant amounts of toxic materials. WASTEWATER AND WATER SUPPLY There are two types of wastewater services: central sewer collection systems and onsite systems. Central sewer collection does not usually pose a concern. Onsite systems such the other hand, may be more problematic, particularly for older homes. No matter what kind of onsite system is in the ground, you must have it inspected by a professional to determine if it is working properly. old systems like cesspools may need to be replaced with newer systems that meet today's codes. Even working septic systems may require repairs or at least a cleaning. Be aware that a septic system can not dispose all of the items you may put in a toilet that is connected to a central sewer. Also know that you are ultimately responsible for any system failures. Like wastewater services, there are also two types of water supply: central systems and onsite wells. Again, central systems are not usually a concern. All public water supplies are tested regularly for contaminants. Onsite wells, however, may be contaminated and require testing prior to buying the house. Check for the presence of coliform bacteria from septic systems and leaking sanitary sewers. Also, test the well for pH heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides, and nitrates/nitrites (chemicals from fertilization or leaking septic systems). Regardless of the type of water supply you may want to buy a filter for your sinks to eliminate taste, odor and trace contaminants. Remember: When it comes to buying a house, you are not alone. Real estate agents, building inspectors, local building officials, and county or local environmental officials are all there to help. Also, talk to neighbors and do as much research as you can-doing your homework and knowing what to look for is your best education when it comes to buying a home. Since you will be living in this house for a long time, you want the experience to be as rewarding and positive as possible. 49 Photograph Leftover pesticides in the soil can seep into groundwater and wells.

Enjoy a weed-free garden by using these four simple techniques and two special hoes. Photograph // Weeds probably discourage more potential gardeners than any other single problem. "Oh, the garden was overgrown with weeds and we finally gave up" is a common explanation of many frustrated gardeners, but it doesn't need to be that way. Have you ever heard anyone say, "Oh, the living room finally got so dusty that we just stopped using it"? We don't stop enjoying the living room because of dust. We simply vacuum or sweep every so often to keep the room clean. It's the same for your garden: Regularly cleaning your garden by weeding is one of the keys to keeping your crops productive and your enthusiasm strong. Here are the top weed-prevention strategies, plus the two best weeding hoes. First, don't dig the garden. Plowing or deep tilling buries weed seeds, then brings them back up. Let buried seeds stay buried. Most weed seeds germinate only in the top two inches of soil. Do. Each plant can produce an enormous number of seeds. The old saying "One year's seeding means seven years' weeding" holds. The results of this carelessness are cumulative: The more seeds you have, the more weeds you have. But the results of care also are cumulative: If weed plants are removed from the garden and placed in the compost heap before they go to seed, their thousands of seeds won't be added to the garden. No seeds, no weeds. And, as the years progress, fewer and fewer seeds will be left in the garden to germinate. Till twice before you sow. Before you plant a new garden, till the soil shallowly to encourage weed seeds to sprout, then water the area if the soil is dry. The combination of air, moisture and exposure to light will stimulate weed-seed germination. Wait a week after tilling and then hoe or till again to eradicate all the newly germinated weed seedlings before you plant. The more times you seeds you will have lurking in your garden beds. Once the upper-layer weed seeds are exhausted (it takes a number of years, so be patient), very few new weeds will appear unless you bring them up from below or let weeds mature and drop new seeds. Dispatch weeds while they are small. Tiny, newly germinated weeds are the easiest to kill. A sharp hoe drawn shallowly through the soil between the crop rows will quickly dispatch small weeds. Cultivating is the gentle stirring of the soil's surface to uproot newly germinated weeds before they become a problem. That minimum effort yields a maximum benefit, curing the weed problem, while making a tidy garden. And a well-kept garden may motivate you to spend more caretaking time there. Photograph The thin, angled blade of the collineal hoe lets you easily sweep away weeds. // THE PERFECT HOE For cultivating, an effective hoe is sharp; angled for drawing, not chopping; slim, so as not to bulldoze soil onto the vegetable the crop rows without damage. It also must be comfortable and fun to use, or you will find some other way to spend your time. Years ago I could never find such a hoe, so I made my own. Today you can buy this tool, which I call the collineal (which means "in the same straight line") hoe. Various interpretations of this design are sold by a number of garden tool catalogs (see "Special Offer," Page 45). It is designed for skimming in soft, fertile soil rather than for chopping compacted earth. For my collineal hoe, I wanted an efficiently designed tool, not a crude bludgeon. I also wanted a hoe I could use standing upright, to minimize back strain. Since that meant I would be holding it with my thumbs up the handle, as with a broom or leaf rake, I had to find the ideal angle between the blade and the handle for a shallow, skimming action. Seventy degrees turned thin and narrow as possible so that it would cut and skim without gouging and bulldozing. Because the blade was narrow, the cutting edge could line up with the centerline of the hoe handle, ensuring an accurate aim in cutting weeds rather than crops. Finally, I sharpened the blade like a razor, so the cutting edge would be right next to the soil. A sharp hoe allows you to work shallowly and not disturb the roots of the crop plants. Using this collineal hoe with the proper angle and a thin, sharp blade is like dancing with a skilled partner, and just as enjoyable. Hold it in a ballroom-dancing position, with your thumbs upward. Stand comfortably with your back straight. The hoe blade draws effortlessly through the soil of the growing areas. Hoe when weeds are very small, gently cultivating the soil's surface. Go out to the garden on a summer's evening, put a Strauss waltz on the stereo and dance with your hoe. Weed control has never been compaction in your garden should be in the paths. For those areas, a stirrup hoe, with its thin double-edged stirrup blade, will make your life easier. The stirrup is hinged where it attaches to the handle so it swings back and forth slightly, and the hinged action changes the angle of the blade to the soil so that it cuts smoothly, whether you are pushing or pulling. This hoe is held with the thumbs pointing clown the handle so that a lot of power can be applied. It can cut effectively just below the soil's surface or go deeper if you wish. The cutting blade fits nicely in the paths between the beds where your feet have passed. We use this hoe while moving clown the paths backward, working the hinged action of the hoe back and forth in the compacted soil. It neatly cuts off all weeds and leaves a fresh, aerated surface. If you use the collineal and stirrup hoes just a few minutes each time you visit your garden, you crops weed-free and your garden a place you'll enjoy.
Harness the power of flowing water for clean, sustainable home electricity. // Home-scale hydroelectric power systems offer an opportunity for humans to forge an intelligent and sustainable partnership with sunshine, rain and running water. Sometimes dubbed "microhydro," this approach uses low-impact mechanical systems to harness moving water to generate clean, reliable electric power. Unlike the intermittent power from wind or solar systems, hydroelectric power can flow night and day from yearround streams. A hydroelectric system converts the force from flowing water into electricity. You take the kinetic energy of water flowing downhill from a stream or river and direct it onto a wheel in a turbine that converts the rotational energy to electricity. The amount of power produced depends on the volume of water flowing onto the turbine and the vertical distance it falls through the system. Equipment costs range from about $1,000 for the smallest, to $20,000 for a system large enough to power several modern homes. "Many microhydro systems generate 75 to 350 kilowatt hours (kWh) per month," Scott Davis explains in his book, Microhydro the MOTHER EARTH NEWS "Books for Wiser Living" series. Davis is a renewable energy developer with decades of microhydro experience. In fact, it's his life's work, and he's gathered all his knowledge, experience and enthusiasm into this concise, easy-to-understand manual. His book covers the entire subject, from the essentials of site selection to the nitty-gritty of hardware choices and installation. THE BASICS To implement a successful microhydro system, you will need the following basic requirements: * At least 2 gallons pet minute of flowing watet, and a lot of drop; or 2 feet of drop and 500 gallons pet minute of watet flow. * A proper turbine, alternator and shelter from bad weather. * Permission from the relevant authorities, even if the project is entirely on your own land. * A water intake and enough pipeline or "penstock" to divert water to the turbine and return it to the stream. * A transmission line to move the power from the alternator to the point to convert the electricity to an alternating current (AC), and a controller for the electrical system. Photograph Scott Davis, author of Microhydm: Clean Power from Water, has decades of experience with microhydro technology. Beside him a stream flows at about 20 gallons per minute - just the right size for a small microhydro system. // SITE ASSESSMENT If you're lucky enough to have an abundance of flowing water, you may be tempted to envision projects that are larger than what is normally required. Davis stresses that you should plan to produce only the power you need, not the maximum amount possible. If you don't have an obvious microhydro location - but you still have access to running water - you still may be able to set up a system. In its simplest form, the energy potential of flowing water depends on its flow rate (usually measured in gallons per minute) multiplied by the pressure behind that flow (related to the overall distance of water drop, called "head" to assess your microhydro potential before buying any equipment. Accurate site assessment is key because it identifies the total energy potential that's available, and it all begins with a measurement of water-volume flow rates. "Most microhydro systems use between 2 and 1,000 gallons of water per minute," Davis says. "If you have a spring or very small creek, the amount of available water may be the factor that limits your power output." One of the ways to find the total amount of available water, Davis says, is to use the "container method." Find a spot where the potential stream's water enters a culvert and time how long it takes to fill up a container of a known size. The stream's flow in gallons per minute equals the size of the container in gallons divided by the time it takes to fill in seconds, times 60. For example, if a 5-gallon bucket fills up in 10 seconds, the stream flows at 30 gallons per minute (gpm behind that flow, which relates to the amount of vertical drop the water undergoes as it travels through your site. Pressure measurement combines with flow rate to determine the raw energy potential of a location. In turn, this defines the universe of choices for the hardware necessary to produce the electricity you need at wall sockets, light fixtures and appliances. Flow rate multiplied by pressure equals power. You won't get very far in the microhydro adventure before you realize something important: There's more to a good system than just flowing water. You also are dealing with terrestrial conditions, and that's why creating a stream profile is essential and should be the third factor to consider when choosing your optimum site. "A completed stream profile sounds something like this," Davis says. "The first 100 feet drops 20 feet. The second 100 feet are not as steep, and drops 16 feet, and so on." What you're aiming for is an accurate representation of the water flow over to good advantage in your plans. By using a surveyor's transit, a water level or a laser level, you can produce a side-view profile - or cross-section - of the entire stream landscape as water runs from pipeline intake to output port. A stream profile also helps you determine the best location for the waterintake end of the pipe. This is where most of your regular maintenance will happen (cleaning out brush and stream debris, for instance), so you need to choose a spot with easy access, if possible. Also, if the flow rate of your stream is more than a few gal-, lons per minute, you may find J several possible locations for the turbine itself. The stream profile often makes it easier to identify optimal turbine placement, which usually consists of a stable water level, accessibility and water relatively free from debris. Another important consideration is to place the turbine in an area where it won't be affected by freezing water.

Top: This Pelton turbine generates power when the jet of water strikes the cupped runner along its circumference. // Most microhydro installations include a pipeline that diverts water over land down from an area of high elevation, connecting to an enclosed water wheel (that's the turbine) at some lower level. This situation raises key questions: Will a 2-inch-diameter pipe give you the best energy potential in relation to the cost of the material and its flow rate? How does this compare with a 4-inch pipe? Will your energy expectations be met with a 500-foot pipeline, or do you need a 1,000-foot pipe to get more head (water pressure)? How will flow volume, vertical drop and friction in the pipe affect the amount of power generated? All these questions are important because they each can have a tremendous effect variations in pipe size, flow rate and static head yielded a 350-percent output difference across the four options examined. THE HARDWARE Most people who choose hydropower are attracted to the fascinating variety of unusual hardware that makes clean, lowcost electricity. Turbines complete the first part of the energy-conversion process, and in many ways, they're the heart of any hydropower system. Many designs are available, but most include some kind of fanlike wheel on a shaft - set within a metal case that contains and directs water flow to spin the blades. Turbines are designed for both low- and high-pressure applications. High-head impulse turbines are the most versatile - used for situations with heads ranging from 6 to 600 feet - and can generate enough power to sustain most any requirement given the right conditions. The Turgo impulse turbine uses a jet of water to strike the enclosed water wheel at an angle. Because the impulse turbine uses more water, significant power can be generated with less head, which may result in shorter penstocks. The the enclosed water wheel along its circumference, which can be slightly more efficient than the Turgo turbine, Davis says, and is used especially for low-flow, highhead situations. Low-head turbines are meant for heads under 10 or 12 feet. These turbines are ideal candidates to charge batteries a long way from the powerhouse at low expense. The LH-IOOO - made by Energy Systems and Design - will produce power from as little as 2 feet of head, and the Powerpal - made by Asian Phoenix Resources - is a complete small-scale AC system. Constructing your own microhydro system also can be a viable option. Many different methods can be good alternatives to purchasing commercially produced turbines and alternators, but the efficiency and effectiveness of a homemade system depends much on its design. A centrifugal pump can be made into a backward-running Francis turbine (in which water flows through the turbine runner); an induction motor can be used as an alternator; and a crossflow turbine can be fabricated with readily available materials common to Third World ideas on how to make homemade systems. The electrical side of any hydropower facility always includes a device to convert the mechanical energy of a spinning shaft into electrical energy (either a generator for direct current or an alternator for AC). That electrical energy is then sent through a series of components called the "balance of system" equipment, which saves and regulates the electricity once it's generated. But before you tackle the electrical side of hydropower, you need to understand something about the two basic types of electricity: direct current (DC) and AC. DC is the sort of electricity delivered by a battery. Imagine a whole bunch of electrons piled up against one pole of a battery, desperately trying to get to the other pole. When you close the circuit across both poles, energy flows in one direction and can spin a motor or light a bulb in the process. DC electricity is more complicated to generate than AC, and it travels less efficiently. That said, you can it more useful for small hydropower applications that need to build up a stockpile of energy to meet large intermittent loads. AC is the type you get from the grid; just think about it as a series of rising and falling voltage waves. In a typical grid-delivered power system, this riseand-fall cycle happens 60 times a second. Most appliances are designed to run on AC power only. Smaller hydropower systems might include a series of deep-cycle batteries for storing DC energy for intermittent high demand, though having a DC foundation to your system doesn't necessarily rule out the option of AC output, as well. The secret is something called an inverter. "These convert directcurrent battery power (DC) into the kind of alternating current (AC) that we're all familiar with," Davis says. Photograph A Powerpal low-head AC turbine like this one can provide up to 1 kilowatt of power. Water rushes down the manmade aqueduct, then drains into a pipe that's connected to a turbine near the boy are medium to high, you should consider a microhydro system that generates AC power with an alternator right from the start. At that level, you're nearing the point where electrical space heating can be part of your plans. "A 10-kilowatt system that runs in the winter," Davis says, "can provide heat that is the equivalent of burning 12 cords of firewood in a sixmonth heating season." To understand how a microhydro setup operates in real life, it's often useful to look at examples. At the smaller end of the microhydro spectrum, a remote homestead in British Columbia wanted to produce enough electricity to run lights, radio, radiophone and stereo with an existing 1-inch domestic water supply pipe. The residents had doubts they would still have enough water to run their showers and toilets after the conversion, given the water's static pressure only amounted to 65 pounds per square inch (psi). They installed a Harris hydroelectric turbine with a Ford alternator close to the house that produces chose a 500-watt inverter as the electrical subsystem. This system provides for the homestead's lights, radio and stereo, but propane provides other vital home services such as refrigeration and cooking. And at the larger end of the microhydro spectrum, a remote First Nations American Indian community in British Columbia needed a high-output system, but the area's geography challenged the development of a microhydro system. Using an excavator, Davis and his crew dug a usable trench and laid a 4-inchdiameter pipeline, traveling over 900 feet and delivering 350 gpm over 315 feet of vertical head. This hydroelectric system generates a whopping 7,200 kWh per month at a continuous output of 10,000 watts using an 8-inch Pelton turbine wheel, directly driving a brushless 12kilowatt alternator. Microhydro is a clean, sustainable source of power for homesteads in the right location. By considering some of the preceeding requirements, you'll know if it can be a possibility for you. If it is, Davis' book and other resources will give you a more thorough look a sound foundation for further development.

A lot of the angry Californians who helped pass Proposition 187 -- to deny costly welfare, health care and public education to undocumented aliens -- probably had someone like Hilda Pacheco in mind when they pulled the lever in November. Pacheco, 32, entered the state illegally from Mexico in 1978, never finished high school and is the single mother of two children. People like her, the argument goes, are draining $2.3 billion a year from California's strained health care, prison and education systems while also filling some of the relatively few jobs available in the state's recessionary economy. What's more, they lack the skills ever to contribute as much as they will take. People like her should go home. Such anti-immigrant sentiments echo well beyond California's borders today. Arizona, California, Florida, New Jersey and Texas are suing the federal government for a collective $14 billion -- the states' estimate of their outlay to support, educate, hospitalize and imprison illegal aliens. In Washington, the Commission on Immigration Reform, headed by former Democratic Rep. of legal workers, effective barring jobs from the estimated 200,000 to 300,000 undocumented immigrants each year. And the new Republican majority in Congress has gone further, threatening to cut off welfare benefits even for legal immigrants, except for refugees and those over age 75. Before you reach your own conclusion about these initiatives, you may want to learn more about people like Hilda Pacheco. What you discover may not conform to the talk radio image of immigrants as leeches. Rather than being a drag on the economy, Pacheco -- like most immigrants -- is making it in America. She has never been on welfare, has attained legal status and has elevated herself from a subminimum-wage job at a hamburger stand 16 years ago to her current $50,000-a-year managerial position at a worker-training firm. "I'm sure that illegals pay more taxes than they get credit for," Pacheco says. With immigrants entering the U.S. at a rate of 1 million a year, foreign-born residents -- legal and illegal -- now represent 8.5% of the in 1970. And in California, where fully 40% of recent immigrants settle, 22% of the population was born outside the U.S. Still, foreign-born residents today make up a much smaller portion of the U.S. population than they did following the great wave of immigration at the start of the century, when foreign-born residents peaked at 15%. People who criticize today's immigrants, however, contend that as a whole, the current newcomers are fundamentally different from the 13 million Eastern and Southern Europeans who immigrated to the U.S. in the first half of this century. They surely are different in at least one sense: Just 38% of today's arrivals are white, compared with 88% of those who came before 1960. Critics also argue that our high-tech economy now demands brains, not brawn, which means poorly educated and unsophisticated immigrants have little hope of following their predecessors into the middle class. If you look at the research on immigrants, however, you'll find that much of the pessimism is unwarranted. Contrary to today's immigrants -- legal and illegal -- are doing well, or at least striving to pave the way for their children to live better lives. Figures from the Census Bureau reveal that immigrants who arrived in the U.S. before 1980 actually boast higher average household incomes ($40,900) than all native-born Americans ($37,300). * Few immigrants come here to get on welfare. In reality, working-age, nonrefugee immigrants are less likely than their native-born counterparts to be on the dole. * Immigrant children aren't gobbling up precious educational dollars, either. In fact, only 4% of the $227 billion we spend to educate our children is spent educating legal immigrant children and just 2% is spent on the estimated 648,000 kids who are here illegally. * Immigrants are not long-term drains on our economy. Yes, the estimated 3.8 million illegal immigrants cost us about $2 billion a year, chiefly because many work in low-wage jobs and often don't pay income taxes. But over time, immigrants become productive. As a a year more in taxes than they consume in government services, says the Urban Institute. Like yesterday's immigrants, the newcomers choose America because it offers a chance to prosper. Jeffrey S. Passel, the Urban Institute's director of immigration research and policy, is optimistic about their prospects. "The very act of pulling up stakes and moving to a foreign country indicates that you have initiative and want to better yourself," he says. The successes of today's immigrants hold lessons for us all, whether our ancestors came here on the Mayflower, in slave ships, on a turn-of-the-century steamer or on a jetliner. Jobs, not welfare Immigration's foes are fond of pointing out that 9% of immigrant households collect cash welfare benefits, compared with only 7% of households headed by native-born Americans. But that single statistic paints a misleading picture. Welfare use is high almost exclusively among legal refugees from war-torn or Communist countries, including Cambodia (50% of all households), Laos (46%), Vietnam) and Cuba (16%). Unlike other immigrants, these favored refugees are immediately entitled to public assistance. As a result, 16% of the refugees, in contrast to only 3% of other immigrants who came here during the 1980s, get public aid. The notion that illegal immigrants come to the U.S. to obtain welfare benefits is a myth. Illegals already are barred from all public assistance except for emergency medical care under Medicaid and the women, infants and children (WIC) nutrition program. Further, even a legal immigrant who goes on the dole during his first five years in the U.S. risks deportation. Though few actually get the boot, the law still acts as a deterrent because an immigrant on welfare would have difficulty getting the approvals necessary to sponsor relatives for residency in the U.S., which is a prime goal for many immigrants. Thirty-two-year-old Iraji Khiar reflects the prevalent imminent attitude toward welfare. He fled war-torn Ethiopia in 1977 and spent the next 10 years with family friends in the Sudan before come a few years earlier. But when Khiar arrived in San Diego in 1987, he couldn't locate his relative, and in order to survive, he accepted the Catholic Church's help in signing him up for welfare -- for all of four weeks. At that point, Khiar refused further aid, insisting that he wanted to earn his keep "with my own sweat." He began working as a high school janitor at $7.75 an hour and attending classes toward an associate's degree in business administration from San Diego City College. He later went into the food business with another cousin and her brother. Today the trio typically work 141 hours a week at the Maryam Sambussa Factory, which bakes savory East African pastries, and the Sphinx International Restaurant, which serves up a multiethnic stew of East African and African-American foods. The Sphinx features African and American music -- when it's not karaoke night. The dream is alive Academics have found that the longer immigrants are here, the more likely they: a home and their own business. For example, among immigrants who have lived here five to nine years, 44% own their own homes. That figure rises to 55% after at least 10 years. Some scholars believe that immigrants eventually pull ahead of natives in the income race because their work habits aren't constricted by our notions of the typical eight-hour workday. Further, a willingness to strike. out on their own has allowed many immigrants to earn more money sooner than they would have in the corporate world, given their often limited command of English. Overall, the same portion (7%) of immigrants as native-born Americans are self-employed, and both groups of entrepreneurs earn, on average, about $30,000 a year. Yet for some ethnic groups, self-employment rates are significantly higher, particularly for Koreans (18%) and Iranians (12%). Immigrants also are well represented in highly skilled professional and technical jobs. Two of every 10 U.S. physicians are foreign-born, for example, as is one in immigrants who arrived here after 1980 will never do as well as natives because they're more likely than their predecessors to have come from Third World nations. Only time will tell whether recent immigrants' median household income of $31,100 will rise. Still, a closer look at the facts reveals that these newcomers aren't as disadvantaged as they first appear. Explains University of Texas sociologist Frank D. Bean: "To say that today's immigrants are of lower quality than their predecessors puts an unfair onus on them. They actually have more education than immigrants who came here 20 years ago." Indeed, between 1970 and 1990, the percentage of immigrants with college degrees climbed from 19% to 27%. Meanwhile, the portion of immigrants who dropped out of high school fell to 37% from 48%. (By comparison, 15% of native-born Americans are high school dropouts and 27% are college graduates.) Nearly half (47%) of African immigrants hold college degrees. Even if you assume that most immigrants who lack college market, it's wrong to presume that they won't become taxpayers or that their children will get stuck in low-wage jobs. As Michigan State sociologist Ruben G. Rumbaut, an expert on recent immigrants, reminds us: "At the turn of the century, many people argued that the U.S. was attracting immigrants who had little education and few job skills. But the fact that you came here as a peasant didn't mean that your children would forever be part of the unwashed underclass." Immigrant kids: Moving to the head of the class The widely held belief that most immigrant kids demand to be taught in their native languages indefinitely is also dead wrong, as is the notion that we are spending a ton of money on bilingual education. Federal spending on bilingual education, adjusted for inflation, actually fell 48% during the 1980s, despite a 50% increase in the number of public school children with limited proficiency in English. In addition, studies show that English is the language of choice for the children experience of the Rev. Nancy C. Moore, senior pastor of Faith United Presbyterian Church in Los Angeles' predominantly Hispanic Highland Park neighborhood, is instructive. Since most of the 72 children who signed up for Sunday School two years ago were Hispanic, Mrs. Moore decided to assign two teachers to each classroom, one who spoke English, another who spoke Spanish. She dropped the plan, however, when she discovered that 69 of the kids already knew English and that the three who didn't wanted to be taught in their adopted language, not their parents' tongue. There's also plenty of evidence that immigrants' children are performing well academically, despite poverty, poorly educated parents and discrimination -- problems often associated with underachievement in native-born Americans. Even children who missed years of school while detained in refugee camps abroad do amazingly well. In one study, for example, University of Michigan researchers tracked 536 Vietnamese, Laotian and Chinese-Vietnamese children who attended public schools in low-income sections of Boston, Chicago, Houston,. Most were B students, more than a quarter regularly got A's, and only 4% had grade point averages at or below C. They also did better than average on a standardized achievement test; in math, an impressive 27% ranked in the top 10% nationwide. Why do these kids remind us of Horatio Alger rather than Bart Simpson? Because their parents preached a mantra that has served immigrants for generations: Control your destiny through education. The kids, in turn, relish the chance to learn; in their homelands, education is generally reserved for the wealthy. As a result, families gather around their kitchen tables on weeknights, with older children expected to assist younger siblings. The University of Michigan researchers found that, on average, immigrant grade school students studied two hours and five minutes a night, while high school kids hit the books three hours and 10 minutes. The typical American junior or senior high school student studies only an hour and a half per day. Unfortunately, other researchers it is often because of overassimilation into American culture. In other words, the longer they live here, the more television they watch and the less homework they do -- results that reflect more poorly on us than them. Another myth: Success is limited to Asian kids. A study of Salvadoran, Guatemalan and Nicaraguan illegals who attended overcrowded, violence-plagued schools in the San Francisco area found that they were the academic stars of otherwise dismal institutions. Although two-thirds of the 50 Central American students surveyed worked 15 to 30 hours a week to supplement their families' income, half made the honor roll. The most astonishing achievements, however, belong to the Hmong, people who were subsistence farmers and CIA operatives in the mountains of northern Laos during the Vietnam War. Many adult Hmong are not literate even in their native language, and a disturbing three-quarters of their households are on welfare. Yet studies of Hmong schoolkids in San Diego and St. Paul conducted during the past four years reveal that they earn better grades by one San Diego teenager he interviewed a few years ago. The girl's mother had died giving birth to her eighth child; her father remarried and had six more children. In the U.S., the family of 16, joined by the girl's maternal grandparents, squeezed into two apartments. The girl was responsible for keeping house, so she usually couldn't start studying until midnight. Yet she scored 1216 on the SAT (the national average is 902). Muses Rumbaut: "Whenever I think of that girl, I know it's unwise to make pronouncements about the future success of immigrants' children simply by looking at aggregate census data on recent immigrants' education and income." Yet despite immigrant accomplishments, some Americans seem determined to keep whispering: No matter what, they'll never be real Americans. They'll keep their strange customs, congregate in ethnic enclaves, and as their numbers and economic well-being increase, they will demand political power. And if they do, well,, ragtag ethnic tribes that landed on our shores three or four generations ago and still insist on clinging to such rituals as polka dancing, playing boccie and marching in the St. Patrick's Day parade. Aren't we better off for having let them in?
Hot prospects range from tech consulting to home remodeling, and several can be launched from your home for only a few thousand dollars in seed money. // IF YOU'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT STARTING YOUR own business,' 98 will be a good year to follow through. The economy is expected to remain strong with interest rates relatively low What's more, two-thirds of owners of small and mid-size companies-those with fewer than 500 employees-expect their revenues and profits to increase during the next 12 months, according to a recent report by Arthur Andersen's small business advisory arm, the Enterprise Group. To join these upbeat entrepreneurs, you must first identify a growing market with an unmet demand-say, businesses that need tech consultants and work-force trainers, or the swelling ranks of the elderly who require all sorts of services. To help you find these sweet spots, MONEY canvassed small business owners, consultants and trend watchers. All the ventures in the seven categories described below can be launched for under $20,000 and some for just a few grand. Web retailing. Commerce on billion in annual sales to more than $220 billion in 2001, according to International Data Corp., a market research firm in Framingham, Mass. To capitalize on this boom, go online with a product that people like to order by phone or are actively buying from catalogues. You'll need experience with interactive technology and a flair for marketing. That nicely describes Ken Burke, 31 (below), who has an M.B.A. from the University of Southern California. He saw that "businesses wanted to get their products and services on the Web." So, with just $10,000 in seed capital, Burke founded Multimedia Live in 1995 to create "cybershopping malls" where anyone with a computer and a modem can buy anything from floral bouquets to auto parts. His largest site, Choicemall.com, is home to some 1,600 stores and serves 500,000 visitors a month. Burke says his company, based in Novato, Calif., will net a profit of $1.5 million in 1997.

Access Research, a retirement services consultancy based in Windsor, Conn., surveyed 750 workers across the U.S. in 1996 and found that 20% would pay for aid in sorting out their 401(k) retirement savings options. No wonder 86% of certified financial planners expect their client rosters to swell in the next five years, according to a survey by the National Endowment for Financial Education. Jill Gianola, 46, a former economist and small business consultant, completed a course from the College for Financial Planning to become a feeonly certified planner in 1994. Gianola today helps more than 60 middleincome clients create budgets, retirement plans and college-financing strategies. She expects to bring in about $70,000 in 1997. Getting started: Call the College a certified financial planner. Small business consulting. Over the past 10 years, employment at U.S. companies with fewer than 100 workers increased by 2 million, even as it dropped by 10 million at the 1,000 largest firms. "But many small business start-ups need expert advice to get up and running," says Gene Fairbrother of the National Association for the Self-Employed in Washington, D.C. To succeed, you should have a background in business and experience with start-ups. Four years ago in north Dallas, Charles Vanstory, 48, launched Vanco Consulting to help small firms fine-tune their strategies. He boasted 20 years of experience running successful start-ups in the restaurant and oil industries.

(See page 27 for an interview with Celente about his book, Trends 2000, available in paperback from Warner Books for $14.99.) Home offices are now in 43% of households, according to the International Data Corp., and many people are upgrading rather than moving to a new home. Home remodeling sales reached $115 billion in 1996 and will grow to $180 billion by 2005, reports the Remodelors Council of the National Association of Home Builders in Washington, D.C. The NAHB estimates that by 2010, spending on remodeling will surpass spending on new homes. You can profit from this trend if you are, say, a skilled carpenter or plumber ready for the added responsibilities of being a contractor.

. Jennifer and Darryl Hazelwood lost their house and most of their personal belongings to Hurricane Katrina. One year and six moves later, they're finally ready to put down roots and rebuild their lives. JENNIFER AND DARRYL HAZELWOOD walk slowly across the weed-infested lawn of what was once their dream house. She has not stepped inside since it was swallowed by the floodwaters of Hurricane Katrina nearly a year ago. What they see is a nightmare. Their couch seems to float in the air, one end perched on a kitchen counter, the other incongruously held aloft by a baby stroller. The TV cabinet has a large hole in the back where their big-screen model smashed through. The stench of mold is strong, and reminders of their lost life are scattered everywhere -- dolls, books, pillows, a plastic cup here, a shattered table there. There is no comfort in knowing that all the single-story homes in their middle-class neighborhood in New Orleans met the same fate thanks to a breach in the nearby London Avenue canal. The floodwaters turned their home into crazily for nearly a month until the area could be drained. "See this line here?" Darryl says, pointing to a spot a few inches below the ceiling. "That's how high the water was." How does a family recover from such devastation -- physically, emotionally and financially? That's the question Jennifer, Darryl and tens of thousands of other Katrina refugees are still struggling with. Since evacuating to Houston the day before the storm hit, the Hazelwoods have moved six times, most recently sharing a two-bedroom apartment with Jennifer's brother Brad and his wife in nearby Mandeville, La. The prolonged crisis has given daughter Emily, 21 months, nightmares and has upset 5-month-old Dylan's food and sleep routines. It has strained Darryl and Jennifer's marriage and sent her into periods of depression. "Yeah," she sighs during a tour of Brad's spartan guest room, where the four of them sleep, "this is getting old." Still, the Hazelwoods,. They have gotten most of the insurance money they are owed. Jennifer is a public school teacher and co-owner of a successful ballet school. Darryl's construction job earns him plenty of overtime pay. And they recently took a huge step toward returning to their beloved city by putting in the winning bid on a two-family home in Lakeview, an upscale neighborhood they'd always coveted but could never afford. Gambling that New Orleans will come back to life, however, is riskier than a blackjack game at Harrah's. The Hazelwoods' new neighborhood was as ravaged by Katrina as their old one, and the new house will need a year's worth of renovations before it is habitable. Their plan to finance the new house is dicey too. And they've just been told by brother Brad's landlord that they'll have to move again -- six people in one apartment apparently violates fire-code regulations. Meanwhile, somewhere off the Gulf Coast, new hurricanes are stirring. "The future," Darryl drawls at this moment. The Flight from Katrina Jennifer and Darryl met through friends five years ago at a karaoke bar on Bourbon Street. They are complete opposites, he says. He dropped out of high school to join the military; she's a college grad who loves ballet. It didn't seem to matter. They married in 2003, and Darryl moved into the modest house Jennifer owned near Lakeview, where most of her family lived. When Katrina began sweeping across the Gulf Coast in August of 2005, Emily was nine months old and Jennifer had just learned that she was pregnant again. The couple were reluctant to evacuate; they'd spent 13 hours in gridlocked traffic the previous summer fleeing Hurricane Ivan, which turned out to be a dud. But on Sunday morning, they woke up to reports that Katrina had grown into a Category 5 monster and knew they had to go. Fast. They grabbed clothes to last a few days, wedding pictures and a bag marked "vital documents." After driving all day and most of the night in bumper-to-bumper traffic, they ended up at a Marriott in Houston. They watched the collapse of the levees back home on the hotel TV. Darryl's mother called to say that she saw their house on the news -- but only the peak of the roof. The rest of it had drowned in eight feet of water. They moved three more times before settling into a two-bedroom rental outside New Orleans. (They moved in with Brad when that lease was up.) Dylan was born in April, and they were thankful he didn't have to come home to a FEMA trailer. But the gratitude wore thin as the magnitude of their losses began to sink in: their beautiful home, Jennifer's ballet school, their neighborhood full of family and friends. "After the baby was born," she says, "everything just hit me at once." The children became increasingly fractious, and the relationship between Darryl and Jennifer grew strained kind of house to build. "The storm seemed to either bring people closer together," she says, "or tear them apart." Turning a Corner One thing the couple didn't argue about was money. While New Orleanians from cabdrivers to Ph.D.s suddenly found themselves unemployed, the Hazelwoods were not among them. Jennifer did lose $800 a month in income when her ballet school was destroyed. And her salary dropped from $38,000 to $24,700 when she went on maternity leave in February. But her loss in earnings has been partially offset by a rise in Darryl's: As a handyman for a construction firm, he is busier than ever, doing grisly jobs like removing drowned animals from bank lobbies and shoveling out mounds of mud. He's on track to make $40,000 this year. Not much federal disaster assistance was available for middle-class couples like the Hazelwoods. They received $4,358 from FEMA for emergency relief and rental assistance, and that was it. They counted instead on insurance to help them -- They got their first two checks, totaling $50,000, six weeks after the storm. But the next payment, two checks totaling $62,000, took four months to arrive and was $20,000 less than expected. Darryl went back to the house and painstakingly documented each item; seven months later, the final $20,655 was approved. They're still waiting for the check. But the Hazelwoods aren't complaining. Including a few other payouts from their insurance policies, the amount they've collected so far is more than $140,000 -- enough to pay off the $109,000 mortgage on their old house, erase $15,000 in credit-card debt and set aside $5,500 in a savings account. The rest went toward clothes, some furniture and dining out, especially on comfort food (creating what locals call their Katrina weight). Their food bills alone now run nearly $1,000 a month. A Place to Call Home What weighs most on the Hazelwoods is no longer having a home of their own. They can't go back to their old house tired of bouncing from place to place. They want to put Katrina behind them. But a year later, they still have nowhere to call home. They know where they want to go. After months of looking and debating, the Hazelwoods have finally found their new dream house, a 20-year-old two-family brick colonial in Lakeview. It has a second floor to store precious belongings in case of flood and is built three feet higher than older buildings. Best of all, they'll be just 10 blocks away from Jennifer's parents. Under ordinary circumstances, the Hazelwoods couldn't afford Lakeview. But these are extraordinary times, and their new neighborhood is a blighted wilderness of rats, broken glass, cracked roads and abandoned cars. The first floor of the new house has been gutted and must be completely redone before they can move in, which is why their bid of $198,000, for a place worth nearly $400,000 before Katrina, was accepted. Even so, financing the purchase is tough. The Hazelwoods gotten preliminary approval for a mortgage covering the entire price, plus another $80,000 loan to pay for the renovations. Luckily, their local lender has given them very favorable terms in a special financing arrangement created to help revive the area. Their 30-year mortgage has a fixed rate of 6.75%, and they're required to pay no principal and only 2% interest until the renovation is completed or for up to one year. The renovation loan is at 2% as well. The real question is what will happen once the house is ready and their payments skyrocket from $400 a month to $2,355 -- more than 50% of their take-home pay. The Hazelwoods are counting on $900 a month from renting out half the house, plus $650 in income from the ballet school, which just reopened in a new location. But that assumes they can complete the renovations in one year in a city where demand for contractors far outstrips supply. And that the rental market remains strong. And that Jennifer's ballet school thrives. The Advice a financial planner in Covington, La. Gadkowski works pro bono for hurricane victims (fpaprobono.org) and agreed to review the Hazelwoods' finances. Here is what she suggests. * SELL THE OLD PROPERTY Darryl and Jennifer know they must demolish their old house. But they are considering holding on to the land as an investment. Local realtors estimate that the property would fetch around $50,000 now. Gadkowski's verdict: Sell it. Combined with their last insurance check, the sale could give the couple a much needed $70,000 to help finance their fresh start. * PAY OFF DEBT use part of the proceeds to pay off the $4,800 they still owe on credit cards and the $23,300 balance on a home-equity line of credit. And resist the temptation to borrow against any equity they build up in the new home. "It's very dangerous to think of home equity as an ATM that you can get money from when you need it," says the planner. * GET A GRIP The Hazelwoods bought their expenses will be. They didn't think about the new furniture they'll have to buy, for instance, or their child-care bills once Jennifer goes back to work. Even under the couple's most optimistic scenarios, Gadkowski believes, they'll feel squeezed when their mortgage payments rise next year. So the planner urges the Hazelwoods to look for places to cut back. Consider buying an inexpensive car with some of the proceeds from the property sale, and dumping the $285-a-month wheels they're leasing now. Maybe put some of the money toward the new mortgage to reduce the payments. And eat out less, knocking off $200 or so from that $1,000-a-month food bill. * LOOK TO THE FUTURE Gadkowski urges the Hazelwoods to save the rest of the money from the property sale for emergencies and their children's education. They should aim to keep about $15,000 in their short-term savings account, enough to cover at least three months of living expenses once their full mortgage kicks in. They should also set aside money to send Emily and Dylan. Cost: $3,000 a year. Jennifer and Darryl aren't sure how much of Gadkowski's advice they'll take. They're especially reluctant to sell the old property. But as the couple prepare for yet another move, they're keenly aware that they have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to start over on solid financial ground in the city they love, and they don't want to blow it. "I'm excited," says Jennifer. "I can't tell if this is really the end of the tunnel, but I'm definitely starting to see the light." This article contains a table. Please see hardcopy of magazine or PDF. THE BOTTOM LINE The Hazelwoods' insurance settlement will not be enough to finance a fresh start. The planner's advice: Sell the old property to help build a cash cushion. Table
